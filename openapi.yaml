      description: |-
        Users want to be able to get their score results after submitting the survey.
        The user can answer 10 or 20 questions. If they answer 20, the scores are averaged between the 10 additional and 10 original questions to get 10 corresponding value scores.
        Then to get a centered score for each value, each score value is subtracted from the overall average of all 10 or 20 questions. This score is returned in the response.
