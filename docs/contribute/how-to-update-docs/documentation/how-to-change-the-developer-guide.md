# How to change the Developer Guide

## GitBook

Gitbook is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge bases. As an open-source project, we are eligible to have a free license.

### Invite

Using the link below you could join our GitBook organization as an editor. Editors are able to read and comment, just like a commenter, but they're also able to edit content in a couple of ways. Firstly, for spaces that are **open** for live edits, editors can edit the content directly. Secondly, for spaces that have live edits **locked**, editors can create and submit [change requests](../../../contribute-as-a-python-dev/how-to-update-docs/documentation/broken-reference/). Editors cannot merge change requests.

## Any other way

`.md` files could be changed like any other source code using your IDE or directly in GitHub. Since we maintain multiple documentation projects see the [documentation changing guide](https://contribute.climatemind.org/v/documentation/) to learn more.

Doing this make sure you've created a new branch from the u- to-date `docs` branch. After that create a PR to merge your changes to `docs`. The `docs` branch merged `develop` from time to time.
