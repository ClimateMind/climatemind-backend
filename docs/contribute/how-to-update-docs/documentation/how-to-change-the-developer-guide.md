# How to change the Developer Guide

## GitBook

Gitbook is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge bases. As an open-source project, we are eligible to have a free license.

### Invite

Using the link below you can join our GitBook organization as an editor. Editors are able to read and comment, just like a commenter, but they're also able to edit content in a couple of ways. Firstly, for spaces that are **open** for live edits, editors can edit the content directly. Secondly, for spaces that have live edits **locked**, editors can create and submit change requests. Editors cannot merge change requests.

## Any other way

`.md` files can be changed like any other source code using your IDE or directly on GitHub. Since we maintain multiple documentation projects see the [documentation changing guide](https://contribute.climatemind.org/v/documentation/) to learn more.

Make sure you've created a new branch from the up-to-date `docs` branch. After that create a PR to merge your changes to `docs`. The `docs` branch is merged to `develop` from time to time.
