# Developer guide

## Overview

The developer guide is the current documentation for developers. It should contain detailed instructions for backend developers working on the REST API.

## Format

All documentation files are in markdown format and have a `.md` extension. All files, with the exception of `SUMMARY.md` and `README.md,`should be located in a `docs` folder.

## Branch

The primary branch for the documentation is `docs`. All changes should be merged to the `docs` branch and then to `develop`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Usage of the `develop` branch is not possible at the moment due to GitBook limitations.
{% endhint %}

## GitBook

We are using [GitBook](https://gitbook.com/) to manage `.md` files but it's acceptable to change `.md` files directly using your IDE or GitHub.
