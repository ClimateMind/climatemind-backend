# üîç Choosing an issue to do

## How to find an issue to work on

{% hint style="success" %}
You are free to choose any unassigned issue to work on.
{% endhint %}

### Issues workflow

We are using [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) to manage the backend repository issues. Multiple views are presented. For example, a [board view](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMind/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=repo%3A%22ClimateMind%2Fclimatemind-backend%22) contains several pipelines with a workflow from left to right.

* New issues will go into the `Backlog` pipeline.
* After prioritizing, the issue status will be changed to `To do`
* `In progress` pipeline contains issues currently in the progress
* `In review` contains issues with a Pull Request
* `Done` pipeline contains issues that closed less than 21 days ago.

### Priority

#### Priority field

The priority field could be used to identify the most urgent issues. Use [filtration by priority ](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMind/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=repo%3A%22ClimateMind%2Fclimatemind-backend%22+priority%3A%22%F0%9F%8C%8B+Urgent%22)on the board view to see issues with specific priority, or use [table view](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMind/projects/2/views/2?filterQuery=repo%3A%22ClimateMind%2Fclimatemind-backend%22) by priority.

{% hint style="info" %}
You could also filter by other fields like `assignee:, label:` etc.
{% endhint %}

#### Issue position

There could be a case when the repo doesn't contain any urgent issues at the moment. If so, the most urgent tasks tend to be at the top of the pipeline in the [board view](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMind/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=repo%3A%22ClimateMind%2Fclimatemind-backend%22).

#### Pipeline priority

[To do](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMind/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=repo%3A%22ClimateMind%2Fclimatemind-backend%22+status%3A%22To+do%22) pipeline is the first place to look for an issue to work on. If it's empty check tasks in [Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMind/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=repo%3A%22ClimateMind%2Fclimatemind-backend%22+status%3A%22%F0%9F%93%8B+Backlog%22) pipeline.

## First Issue

Issues labelled with [good first issue](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMind/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=repo%3A%22ClimateMind%2Fclimatemind-backend%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) marked as a good start for newcomers.
