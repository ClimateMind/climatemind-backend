# Developer guide

## Overview

The developer guide is the current documentation for developers. It should contain detailed instructions for backend developers who are working on REST API.&#x20;

## Format

All documentation files are in markdown format and have a `.md` extension. All files with except of `SUMMARY.md` should be located in a `docs` folder.

## Branch

The primary branch for the documentation is `docs`. All changes should be merged to `docs` branch and then to the `develop`.

## GitBook

We are using [GitBook](https://gitbook.com/) to manage `.md` files but it's acceptable to change `.md` files directly using your IDE or github.&#x20;
