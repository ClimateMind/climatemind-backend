# Manual Testing

## Local API

If you'd like to test the endpoints, you can do this with Postman.

Register for and install Postman from their [website](https://www.postman.com).

We have a collection of tests already available that you can run. Request access from any of the backend team members to our collections.

## Local App

If you'd like to test the application locally with the front-end interface follow the installation guide to make sure both the backend and frontend containers are running.
