# Making a PR



FIXME:&#x20;

We have limited credits with CircleCI. It's fine to make commits or PRs as needed, but before making a PR please do the following:

1. Test your code locally using Postman to ensure that the endpoints return valid responses.
2. Format your code using Pep8 Styling (see below)
3. If your changes affect how the app is run, please modify the documentation accordingly.
4. If your functionality needs to be tested, please include at least one test.
5. Ensure that the lint and build tests pass before requesting a review.
6. Include the Jira ticket number in the PR (ex. "Cm-57 Fixing API Errors")

## Reviewing a PR

1. If the code is modified, make sure to pull the branch and test that the endpoints are working.
2. Make sure the code has passed linting and black before approving

## Merging your PR

The original contributor should merge their branch after receiving one approval review.
