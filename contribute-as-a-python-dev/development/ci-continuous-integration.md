# CI - Continuous Integration

Manual testing by developers is time-consuming and not reliable. The lack of QA team does not allow to test the whole project on each change. Insufficient software testing increases the chance of developer complications and bad user experiences.

CI solves the problem of insufficient testing by laying the foundation of automated test suites. By monitoring the central code repository and running tests on every change that is made, CI collects test results and communicates them to the entire team working on the project.
