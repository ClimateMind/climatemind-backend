# Installation

## Installing the Project

Create a folder to hold the project and git `git clone` both the [Front End](https://github.com/ClimateMind/climatemind-frontend) and [Back End](https://github.com/ClimateMind/climatemind-backend) Repos into it.&#x20;

```bash
mkdir climate_mind && cd climate_mind
git clone https://github.com/ClimateMind/climatemind-backend.git
git clone https://github.com/ClimateMind/climatemind-frontend.git
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The frontend repo must be to in a path that doesn’t have any spaces in the name. If it does, then change the folder names to use “\_” (underscores) instead of “ “ (spaces). This is so the docker commands without errors.
{% endhint %}
