## Communication Channels

The Climatemind project is run by a team of volunteers, distributed all over the globe. All of the communication is done on a dedicated group of slack channels. For now, an invite is required to join a channel. Simply send off an email to: hello@climatemind.org to receive an invite. :)

There is a weekly ‚Äústandup‚Äù usually occurring on Zoom on Sunday evenings (20:00 GMT+1) that is open for everyone that wants to join. The standup is recorded for those that cannot attend. It is recommended to join or listen to the recording in order to sync up with the other members. There is also a separate non-recorded zoom room for breakout discussions etc.

NOTE: To get access to the rooms, please ask for an invite on Slack.
