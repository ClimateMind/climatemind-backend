                    Tourism supports the livelihoods of an estimated one in ten people worldwide andaround 80% occurs around coastal destinations. Coral reefs are popular and exciting places for sightseeing, swimming, snorkelling, diving and boating. For example, Australia's Great Barrier Reef annually attracts 1.9 million visits, generates AUD$5.4 billion from tourism and supports 54,000 jobs. Florida's Coral Reef has an annual estimated tourism value of $1.1 billion and supports 71,000 jobs.


                    Warming oceans due to climate change are causing increases in heatwaves occurring in the ocean (marine heatwaves). The frequency of these marine heatwaves has doubled since 1982, increasing coral bleaching and destruction. Already over 50% of coral reefs have been lost. If yearly CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today, causing over 97% of all coral reefs to die off along with much of the coastal marine life they support. The loss of coral reefs makes coastal destinations less attractive to tourists and negatively affects local economies.

                    longDescription: When people share common origins, destinations, or stops en route, they can ride together. Carpooling uses seats and fuel more efficiently, cutting emissions. Project Drawdown's projection for carpooling focuses on approaches to increase global urban car occupancy, the number of passengers in each car trip. They assume that urban car occupancy can rise from 1.57 in 2018 to 1.75 or 2.0 by 2050, assuming 3 passengers per carpool trip. Carpooling has no implementation costs and can reduce emissions by 4.2-7.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide while saving $2.8-$5.2 trillion in operating costs.
                    shortDescription: Sharing car rides with friends or colleagues reduces the number of cars on the road. Carpooling can reduce emissions by at most 7.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide while saving up to $5.2 trillion in costs.

It protects soil, avoids emissions, and sequesters carbon. \nBased on historic growth on large farming operations, the Project Drawdown analysis (see sources) projects the total area under conservation agriculture will continue growing from 148 million hectares to peak at 400-327 million hectares by 2035. Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9 trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion."

                    longDescription: Electric motors supplant gasoline or diesel engines, which are polluting and less efficient. EVs always reduce car emissions—dramatically so when powered by renewable electricity. In 2018, 2 million electric cars were sold. If electric car ownership rises to 16-23 percent of total passenger km at a first cost of $4.5-5.8 trillion, by 2050, 11.9-15.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide from fuel combustion could be avoided as well as $15.3-21.8 trillion in fuel costs. Project Drawdown's analysis accounts for emissions from electricity generation and higher emissions of producing electric cars compared to internal-combustion cars. Electric cars are several thousand dollars more expensive, but Project Drawdown includes slightly declining electric cars prices, expected due to declining battery costs.

                    A full grown bull Moose can reach 1,300 pounds and stand 6 ft tall at their shoulders, making a fine trophy for any sport hunter. These majestic creatures have evolved to live in colder climates. As heatwaves become more frequent and severe, these animals become heat-stressed and have access to less suitable habitat. By 2050, the total habitat for all mammals is expected to decline globally by 5%–16% of the 2015 level. This can be seen in Minnesota, where a decrease in moose population from 4,000 in 1983 to 100 in 2008 coincided with an average temperature increase of 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit.


                    In addition to reduced habitat, warmer temperatures have enabled the increase in winter ticks. Moose have been found with 50,000 to 70,000 ticks (ten to twenty times more than normal). Ticks weaken the moose and leave them more susceptible to disease. As temperatures continue to rise, viewing and hunting opportunities will continue to decrease. Without intervention we could soon see the loss of this big-game animal.

                    Climate change and rising temperatures are strongly linked to increasing suicide rates, threatening the stability of the future generation’s prosperity. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, “suicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34”, and the rates continue to climb. Studies have found that suicide rates increase by 0.7 percent in the United States when there is 1 degree Celsius of warming. Given the warming trends from our continued emissions of heat-trapping gases, Stanford researchers found “up to 21,000 additional suicides will occur by 2050 within the United States and Mexico” if significant action is not taken. A European study conducted in 2016 found climatic indicators to be a better predictor of suicide than socioeconomic factors after studying 29 countries over 13 years.


                    Studies have found heat waves have the ability to affect our capacity to regulate our emotions, leading to other mental health issues such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in addition to suicide. Combatting these psychological effects is a national concern and requires serious investments in money and time. The Integrated Benefits Institute found that “for every 1,000 US employees, mood disorders in the workforce cost about $232,000 in excess health care treatments and lost work time”. Notably, availability of air conditioners does not prevent the impacts of heat on suicide. In addition to increased funding for suicide prevention, hospitals and other organizations can work to disseminate information on building individual resiliency behaviors. Investing in these preventative measures and addressing climate change could save thousands of lives from suicide alone.

While it is difficult to attribute this solely to rising temperatures due to the number of compounding factors, it is clear warming temperatures are disrupting mental health. Recent studies have found increasing temperatures can lead to more violence, stress, and decreased cognitive function which can result in suicide.


                      Direct intervention methods, such as suicide hotlines, have proven effective at helping people with suicidal thoughts to change their minds. However, these and other research efforts for suicide are often underfunded relative to other public health issues like alcoholism or cancer. As climate change continues to impair our mental well-being, it is critical suicide prevention methods and services receive more funding to keep our communities safe.

For example, lower water reserves and agricultural yields result from a warming planet, forcing people to choose between migration or competition for resources. A study published in Nature estimates “climate has influenced between 3% and 20% of armed conflict risk over the last century”. And David Wallace-Wells claims, “for every half of a degree of warming, societies will see between 10 and 20 increase in the likelihood of armed conflict”. Other researchers, such as Solomon Hsiang and Marshall Burke, have tried to quantify the relationship between climate change and conflict, finding that “each rise in temperature or extreme rainfall by one standard variation increased the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14%.”\n\nThe Pentagon has even recognized the severity of this issue, warning Congress that it poses a national security issue. According to their staff it is a “threat multiplier” because climate change exacerbates the amount of violence surrounding existing threats such as hunger, poverty, and war. People's temperaments are more prone to be anxious and hostile at higher temperatures, where it becomes more difficult to make rational decisions. This is why increased temperatures are the leading cause of conflict in human interaction. As David-Wallace wells notes in his book, \"Heat frays everything. It increases violent crime rates, swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. The hotter it gets, the longer drivers will honk their horns in frustration; and even in simulations, police officers are more likely to fire on intruders when the exercises are conducted in hotter weather. By 2099, one speculative paper tabulated climate change in the US would bring about an additional 22,000 murders, 180,000 rapes, 3.5 million assaults, and 3.76 million robberies, burglaries, and acts of larceny.\" \n\nMigration is another outcome from climate disruption that can lead to violence. The World Bank estimates if we continue burning fossil fuels unabated there could be as many as 200 million climate migrants by 2050, seeking new areas to live when their home can no longer support their family from impacts such as sea level rise, extreme heat, fires, or drought. This means one out of every 45 people would be displaced by climate change. And studies have shown humanitarian crises such as forced migration, lead to an increase in violence against women. At the same time, protection against violence diminishes. With actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these vast migrations can be avoided by up to 80% according to the World Bank. To keep people safe, we must move society away from burning fossil fuels to avoid catastrophic climate change that increases physical violence globally."

Today, some 6.2 million Americans under the age of 18 suffer from asthma. Asthma is made worse by climate change in at least 3 ways: pollen, wildfire smoke, and ozone pollution.\n\nThe increase in carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels encourages faster plant growth, which has caused pollen levels to more than double since 1900. Pollen is expected to quadruple by 2060 compared to 1900 if society continues burning fossil fuels. The rate of asthma — which often occurs alongside pollen allergies — nearly tripled between 1980 and 2010. And researchers have found that global warming is also causing the pollen season to extend longer. The pollen season is now longer by two weeks on average across the U.S., and by at least four weeks in 34 cities. The largest changes have occurred in the West, with increases of two months or more in Bend, Oregon; Medford, Oregon; and Las Cruces, New Mexico. This means that plants that produce pollen, such as ragweed, certain kinds of grass, and trees are able to release more pollen for longer periods of time each year. This is resulting in frequent asthma attacks in people whose asthma are triggered by allergies.\n\nWe are also witnessing more frequent and intense wildfires due to climate change. Wildfires produce smoke that contains particulate matter. The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with development of asthma, especially in children and is also one of the causes of other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. \n\nLastly, hotter temperatures especially in urban areas is resulting in increased ground level ozone pollution. Ozone is typically associated with decreased lung functions, respiratory conditions like chronic pulmonary disease (COPD) and can trigger asthma attacks. \n\nFor all these reasons, climate change is a health emergency that demands immediate action globally to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible."

Managed well, they can restore soil, sequester carbon, and produce wood resources in a more sustainable way. As of 2018, 294.1 million hectares of land were used for tree plantations on degraded land. Establishing tree plantations on an additional 112-174 million hectares of marginal lands can sequester 22.2-35.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050. The use of marginal lands for afforestation also indirectly avoids deforestation that otherwise would be done in the conventional system. At an initial cost of cost of $17-72 billion and lifetime operational cost of $164.8-259.5 billion to implement, this additional area of timber plantations could produce a lifetime net profit of $2.1-3.4 trillion.

Increased access to and quality of voluntary reproductive healthcare, family planning resources, and 12-13 years of schooling are essential components to achieve the United Nations’ 2015 medium global population projection of 9.7 billion people by 2050.

                    Climate change can affect human health in at least two ways: first by worsening  pre-existing health problems and second by creating new health issues. Climate change induces health effects that are varied and diverse, and include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, premature deaths due to extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food- and water-borne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health.


                    Just 10 extreme events associated with climate change in 2012 cost the United States $1.6 billion in healthcare and lost wages, according to the National Resources Defense Council.  In total, these events, stretching from Washington to Florida, led to an estimated 917 deaths, more than 20,000 hospitalizations and nearly $10 billion (in 2018 dollars) in health-related costs. The two highest estimated costs events were for Hurricane Sandy at $3.2 billion and wildfires in Washington at $2.3 billion.


                    As humans continue emitting heat-trapping gasses and climate change continues to intensify,  its effects on health worsen too. These highlight the need to take mitigation actions against climate change and adapt to its unavoidable health impacts.

These costly events often include large hurricanes, putting our coastal communities most at risk.\n\nWith the continued emissions of heat trapping gases by humans, we are driving oceans to warm, fueling more powerful hurricanes. Additionally, this warming is causing hurricanes to more frequently and rapidly intensify and sometimes even stall, where hurricanes grow in strength very quickly and then move very slowly over land, inflicting even more costly damage. \nAs of 2020, the five costliest hurricanes of all time each occurred after 2005 (Irma 2017, Sandy 2012, Maria 2017, Harvey 2017, Katrina 2005) and totaled $497 billion in associated losses. Human-induced climate change played a significant role in increasing these damages. For example, the warming from human heat-trapping emissions have made hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria drop upwards to 9 percent more rainfall, increasing flood damages.

                      Ranked choice voting is a system which has been successfully employed to move past gridlock that comes with difficult issues, such as climate change, in a ‘winner takes all’ system. In a ranked choice system, voters rank all of the listed candidates from first to last instead of placing a single vote for one candidate. This allows voters to express their full range of support and incentivizes candidates to focus on creating strong platforms to address these issues to appeal to more voters. Ranked choice voting is gaining momentum across the country. It has been successfully implemented in St. Paul, Minneapolis, and St. Louis with a growing number of states and cities, such as New York City and California, adding it to their policy.


                      Climate change is one of the key issues that could benefit from this strategy in the form of more policy action. A study from the Yale program on Climate Change Communication found that 72% of moderate Democrats and 38% of moderate Republicans believe “global warming should be a high priority for the president and Congress”. While climate change continues to be seen as an important issue, using ranked choice voting could improve outcomes for climate policy as it influences candidates to broaden their platforms’ appeal.
                    shortDescription: Ranked choice voting ranks voters' preferences rather than voting for one person or party in a 'winner takes all' system. It encourages collaborations in campaigns and partnerships. It has been shown to help get past gridlock for challenging topics, including climate legislation.

It cuts down on travel—especially flying—and its emissions. By avoiding emissions from business air travel, telepresence can reduce emissions by 1-3.8 gigaton of carbon dioxide over thirty years. That result assumes that over 486-676 million business-related trips are replaced by telepresence in 2050. For organizations, the investment of $87-301 billion in telepresence systems pays off with $1.2 -4.4 trillion worth of business travel savings and 107-143 billion fewer unproductive travel hours.

It reduces emissions, increases soil organic matter, and sequesters carbon. From an estimated 11.84 million hectares of current adoption, Project Drawdown estimates regenerative annual cropping to increase to a total of 221-322 million hectares by 2050. This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration and reduced emissions. Regenerative annual cropping could provide a $2.3-3.5 trillion lifetime operational cost savings and lifetime net profit gain of $135-206 billion on an investment of $79-116 billion.

                    More frequent heat waves due to climate change are disrupting students’ test scores, impacting their ability to achieve their goals. Studies show that as temperatures rise, our brain functions slow down. College students taking identical exams had an 11% lower chance of passing when the temperature was 90 degrees Fahrenheit compared to 72 degrees Fahrenheit.


                    Air conditioning is a potential solution, but comes with its own challenges. For many people around the world air conditioning is unaffordable. For example,  87% of homes in the US have air conditioning compared to only 5% of homes in India. Even within the US access to air conditioning is not evenly distributed throughout society. School districts in wealthy areas have money to afford air conditioning, improving the test scores of their students and widening the education gap. Even with equitable air conditioning, the electrical consumption, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions, of more air conditioners need to be considered. Deploying solutions which fight climate change will help educate the students of tomorrow and allow them to achieve their goals and contribute to society.

                      Air conditioning is necessary to avoid harm to people from extreme heat, especially in the tropics and as the climate warms further. However there is a tradeoff between human health and preventing greenhouse gas emissions, as air conditioning units are often powered by fossil fuel energy. In 2018 approximately 20% of electricity use in buildings was for air conditioning and fans worldwide, and this is increasing. Additionally, air conditioning uses HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants, which is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and can leak at any point during the lifecycle of an air conditioning unit, from manufacture to disposal.


                      To prevent air conditioning from contributing to global warming, we need to use renewable energy to power air conditioners. This may require investing in cleaner technologies such as solar, wind and hydro power at large scale. We also need to develop and implement refrigerant alternatives to HFC.
                    shortDescription: Air conditioning is necessary to reduce the deaths and other negative effects on the body from heatwaves. Powering additional units with renewable energy and using units with non-HFC refrigerants is also necessary to prevent additional emissions and reduce environmental impact.

                      It is critical that human rights are always centered, that gender equality is the aim, and that benefits to the planet are understood as positive ripple effects of access and agency. Project Drawdown modeled the influence of two rights-based solutions on global population: universal education and family planning. Increased access to and quality of voluntary reproductive healthcare, family planning resources, and 12-13 years of schooling are essential components to achieve the United Nations’ 2015 medium global population projection of 9.7 billion people by 2050. If investment and support of these fundamental human rights-centered solutions does not materialize, the world’s population could come closer to the higher projection, adding another 1 billion people to the planet.


                      Project Drawdown models the impact of this population difference in more-developed as well as least-and less-developed countries, in terms of how much energy, building space, food, waste, and transportation would be used. The resulting emissions reductions across the entire system could be as high as 85.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide, just within the window of 2020-2050. Health & Education have a compounding impact, however, with greater climate impacts into the future.

                    High heat affects people's ability to concentrate and their health, causing lower labor productivity and employee absenteeism. This is an occupational health and safety issue and negatively affects the success of companies and their contribution to the economy.


                    For every 1.8°F (1 °C) rise in temperatures above 77°F (25°C) there is an average 2% decrease in work performance. This is due to both physiological and cognitive impairment caused by heat exhaustion and dehydration, and a higher risk of injury. High heat negatively affects people in offices with no or inadequate air conditioning, and those working outside such as agriculture, construction and logistics workers. People are also more likely to stay home during heat waves, with resulting loss of income. To make up for reduced output, workers have to work longer hours or more workers have to be hired, both of which cause higher costs to the organization.


                    Human-caused climate change is already having impacts on worker productivity. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most regions.   Already up to 10-15% of annual daylight hours are so hot that productivity is lost. It's projected that heatwaves will lead to a $2 trillion loss in labor productivity by 2030.

                      Carbon taxes, where organizations are charged based on the amount of carbon pollution they emit, have long been talked about as a way to spark a shift to more sustainable ways of living. Globally they are gaining momentum as one of the primary ways to address anthropogenic emissions. Over 3,500 economists, including 27 Nobel laureates, have signed a statement which said a carbon tax was “the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary.”


                      Elected officials in US Congress have been working on a revenue-neutral carbon tax which redistributes the income from the carbon tax back to taxpayers as a way to increase adoption. The preliminary analysis shows that this strategy would not have any major impact on economic growth. In fact, in 2017 the Treasury Department found this strategy would see the income increase in two-thirds of American households. Columbia University economists estimate that every adult with a Social Security number would receive up to $275 a month by 2030. Their study also projected an emissions reduction of 40% within a decade.

This problem of hotter classrooms is exacerbated further for minority students who tend to live in warmer climates. Hotter temperatures can be mitigated with air conditioning but many schools struggle to maintain their yearly budgets and adding air conditioners to every classroom is a major expense. Furthermore, air conditioners soak up a lot of power, which in turn means more emissions, resulting in more warming if renewable energy is not used.

                      Air conditioning is necessary to avoid harm to people from extreme heat, especially in the tropics and as the climate warms further. However there is a tradeoff between human health and preventing greenhouse gas emissions, as air conditioning units are often powered by fossil fuel energy. In 2018 approximately 20% of electricity use in buildings was for air conditioning and fans worldwide, and this is increasing. Additionally, air conditioning uses HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants, which is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and can leak at any point during the lifecycle of an air conditioning unit, from manufacture to disposal.


                      To prevent air conditioning from contributing to global warming, we need to use renewable energy to power air conditioners. This may require investing in cleaner technologies such as solar, wind and hydro power at large scale. We also need to develop and implement refrigerant alternatives to HFC.
                    shortDescription: Air conditioning is necessary to reduce the deaths and other negative effects on the body from heatwaves. Powering additional units with renewable energy and using units with non-HFC refrigerants is also necessary to prevent additional emissions and reduce environmental impact.

                    longDescription: "People are developing technology that can capture carbon from the air to help reduce emissions as we transition to a more sustainable future. These “carbon capture” technologies come in two main forms. The first is a filtering technology which removes the carbon dioxide directly from emissions as they are produced at power plants or factories. The second is called “direct air capture” which pulls out carbon dioxide that is already in the air. Once this carbon is captured, it can be stored underground or converted into a carbon-containing product. \n\nCarbon capture is seen as a vital part of the transition to a carbon neutral economy. According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the deployment of carbon capture and storage is a key part of most of the mitigation pathways to limit future global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Currently only 30 megatonnes of carbon is captured each year. The International Energy Agency expects carbon capture to reach 2,300 megatonnes per year by 2040, which correlates to a seven percent reduction in global emissions. Policies can be implemented which help bring these technologies to market, such as setting higher carbon prices for existing emissions compared to those not in the air yet. However, it is important that these policies create incentive structures that not only alleviate the uncertainty around development and deployment of this technology but also do not encourage continued fossil fuel use alongside it."
                    shortDescription: Similar to trees, humans can artificially capture carbon dioxide from sources of emissions or directly from the air. The carbon is then locked away long term by injecting it deep underground or converting it into products such as fuel, concrete or soap.

Managing leaks and disposal of these chemicals can avoid emissions in buildings and landfills. Substantial emissions reductions could be achieved through the adoption of practices to (1) avoid leaks from refrigerants and (2) destroy refrigerants at end of life, both after the adoption of alternatives to HFC refrigerants. Over thirty years, an increase of over 79% percent of refrigerants that may be released can be contained, avoiding emissions equivalent to 57.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Although some revenue can be generated from resale of recovered refrigerant gases, the costs to establish and operate recovery, destruction, and leak avoidance outweigh the financial benefit—meaning that refrigerant management, as modeled, could incur a net cost of $629.4 billion by 2050.

Fuel-saving ship design, onboard technologies, and operational practices can improve efficiency and trim emissions. A combination of a selection of 17 ship technologies with slow steaming (literally slowing the ship speed) can help reduce fuel consumption of ocean ships of a variety of types. This fuel reduction can be on the order of 50% of today’s consumption rates across the international shipping industry, and if adoption grows to 57-78 percent of international ships, can lead to a 4.4-6.3 gigaton reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 at cost of $530-733 billion. That could save $620-876 billion in fuel costs over the life of the ships.

                    A hotter climate will mean more frequent and severe flooding, affecting all cities and land  which experience rain or are by the sea.


                    Every 1°F rise in average temperature allows the air to hold 4% more water. This means when it rains it can release more water than previously possible. Hurricanes become worse because not only can their clouds hold more water than before, warmer oceans allow hurricanes to become even larger with stronger wind speeds, and enables them to sit on top of cities for longer periods of time. Additionally, climate change is making our usual weather cycles more unusual and unpredictable, meaning that both dry seasons and wet seasons will be intensified. Additionally, sea level rise driven by melting ice caps is flooding coastal areas. All of these mean that once in a lifetime events like droughts, hurricanes, and floods are becoming increasingly common events, and will overwhelm our existing infrastructure.


                    Flooding destroys both lives and property, ruins entire crops, and causes sewage and farm runoff to contaminate living areas and water supplies. The loss of clean water supplies leads to outbreaks of usually easily preventable disease, like diarrhoeal diseases which already kill around half a million children every year.


                    Many vulnerable areas of the United States (as well as other developed countries) are seeing significant residential and commercial development despite the long-term flood risks.  Nationally, the number of Americans living in these high-flood-risk areas in 2016 climbed 14 percent compared to those living in the same neighborhoods in 2000. That’s actually faster than in areas outside of flood zones, where the population increased 13 percent. The United States is spending billions every year to move people into flood-prone areas and keep people living in flood-prone areas. Research shows upwards to 75 percent of people who live in high-risk flood areas in North America are not even aware they are at risk for flooding.


                    In the USA, FEMA spent approximately $48.6 billion to repair or replace public infrastructure such as roads, bridges and utilities between 1998 and 2014. The National Flood Insurance Program paid $2.9 billion per year to citizens for flood-related losses between 2007 and 2017. These costs will only rise as climate change gets more extreme. Climate scientists have estimated that by 2100 somewhere between 17 and 210 trillion dollars worth of assets will be at flood risk due to rising sea levels, requiring massive investments in flood protection to mitigate disasters annually. Not taking responsibility for our climate now means paying more in lives and resources in the future.

Insurance payouts for this averaged out to $2.9 billion per year between 2007 and 2017 according to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is a large quantity of capital that could be used for other causes. This solution is much easier to implement for new construction. For existing properties, government programs exist which can aid the transition to building outside floodplains. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a grant program which covers up to 75% of costs for homes to be demolished or moved."

This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration and reduced emissions. Regenerative annual cropping could provide a $2.3-3.5 trillion lifetime operational cost savings and lifetime net profit gain of $135-206 billion on an investment of $79-116 billion.

Shockingly only 67 of those cases are from troops abroad in Iraq or Afghanistan, with the majority occurring in the US. Not all troops are affected equally. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch found that younger personnel under 20 years of age make up three times as many heat related illness cases as the folks who are 20-24 years old. Additionally, Asian, Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic black service members experience higher rates of heat-related illness.


                    With no action taken to reduce global warming, military installations in the US could experience five times as many days with a heat index above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. This equates to an average additional 33 days per year. Some bases would experience even greater extremes. For example, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona could experience an additional 17 days per year with a heat index above 120 degrees Fahrenheit.


                    Climate change poses a large threat to our national security by way of military readiness, but there are steps that can be taken. In addition to solutions which tackle emission reductions, training commanding military personnel about heat-related illnesses and safeguards that can be put in place can mitigate cases right now. Similarly, medical protocols can be put in place to ensure people receive the correct treatment as soon as they fall ill. With these efforts in place, our troops will be able to overcome this threat.

Two key assumptions inform that conclusion: (1) recycled paper produces about 25 percent fewer total emissions than conventional paper, and (2) the percentage of recycled paper being used to produce paper would rise from 55 percent to 69-74 percent by 2050. Although increasing recycled paper content uses more electricity, the emissions related to harvesting and processing—and the total emissions from pulping and manufacturing—are higher for paper using virgin wood feedstock. The emissions reductions for this solution do not include carbon sequestration from standing trees that would not be harvested if the use of recycled paper grows.'

It protects soil, avoids emissions, and sequesters carbon. \nBased on historic growth on large farming operations, the Project Drawdown analysis (see sources) projects the total area under conservation agriculture will continue growing from 148 million hectares to peak at 400-327 million hectares by 2035. Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9 trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion."

                    Air pollution refers to any pollutant in the air which can harm human health. Over time, the amount of pollution in the air has increased due to human activity, disproportionately affecting the wellbeing of children. A large part of a child’s lung develops after birth. Because of this, exposure to increased levels of pollution puts children at a greater risk of reduced lung growth, respiratory infections, and developing future chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease. According to CNN, “around 93% of the world’s children under 15 years of age breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk”. CNN reports that in 2016 alone, 600,000 children were estimated to have died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air.”


                    Studies have been conducted which show that reducing air pollution can protect against these harmful impacts. A 2016 report looked at children living in Southern California across three separate time periods (1993-2001, 1996-2004, 2003-2012) and found the children living during periods of better air quality suffered fewer bronchial symptoms. The WHO recommends policies such as the use of renewable energy to curb emissions to improve air quality and help secure children’s futures around the world.

For example, coal mining is a polluting sector that has declined in the US. In West Virginia, mining jobs have declined nearly three times faster than the decline in coal production. Encouraging miners to move into climate-friendly sectors such as renewable energy reduces the risk of unemployment and often provides better pay.\n\nHowever, government investment in re-training, job creation, and new technologies may be needed to achieve a successful transition to a green economy.

                    Stroke is the number one cause of motor disabilities and the second cause of cognitive disorder and death worldwide. Air pollution is a causal factor in 30% of strokes and 21% of deaths from stroke. Particulate matter air pollutants make brain cells more likely to die when a stroke occurs. There is also evidence that air pollutants make blood inside blood vessels more likely to clot, causing strokes when those clots are dislodged, caught in the brain, and then block blood flow to the brain. This reduces the oxygen supply to brain cells, which then die and cause motor disabilities or death.


                    A warmer climate makes strokes worse. Burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases that drive a warming climate which significantly raises the risk for stroke. When the air pollution from burning fossil fuels meet higher temperatures, they produce ground-level ozone, a polluting gas, and smog. Climate change makes these air pollutants more toxic and exposure to them short term and long term increases the risk of stroke. Additionally, high temperatures dry out vegetation, increasing the frequency and ferocity of wildfires, and producing more ash and smoke pollution called particulate matter that also worsen stroke risk.


                    This demonstrates how climate change and the continued burning of fossil fuels cause health emergencies, and we need to act now to protect ourselves and our loved ones.

This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration and reduced emissions. Regenerative annual cropping could provide a $2.3-3.5 trillion lifetime operational cost savings and lifetime net profit gain of $135-206 billion on an investment of $79-116 billion.
                    shortDescription: Building on conservation agriculture, regenerative annual cropping can include compost application, green manure and organic production. It reduces emissions, increases soil organic matter and sequesters carbon.

                    longDescription: Composting can range from backyard bins to industrial-scale operations. Regardless, it converts organic waste into soil carbon, averting landfill methane emissions in the process. In 2015, an estimated 38 percent of food waste was composted in the United States; 57 percent was composted in the European Union. If all lower-income countries reached the U.S. rate and all higher-income countries achieved the E.U. rate, composting could avoid methane emissions from landfills equivalent to 2.1-3.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050. That total excludes additional gains from applying compost to soil. Compost facilities cost less to construct but more to operate, which is reflected in the financial results.

Fuel-saving ship design, onboard technologies, and operational practices can improve efficiency and trim emissions. A combination of a selection of 17 ship technologies with slow steaming (literally slowing the ship speed) can help reduce fuel consumption of ocean ships of a variety of types. This fuel reduction can be on the order of 50% of today’s consumption rates across the international shipping industry, and if adoption grows to 57-78 percent of international ships, can lead to a 4.4-6.3 gigaton reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 at cost of $530-733 billion. That could save $620-876 billion in fuel costs over the life of the ships.

GDP is already significantly smaller than it could be due to the effects of global warming. Each 1.8° Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming reduces growth by 1% on average, and the planet has already warmed by 1.8° Fahrenheit. One reason for this is an increased frequency of heat waves and extreme temperatures. \n\nHeat affects people's ability to concentrate and their health, causing lower labor productivity and employee absenteeism, which in turn affect the success of companies and their contribution to the economy. Studies indicate an average 2% decrease in work performance per °C temperature rise (1.8° F) when the temperature is above 25°C (77°F). \n\nThe frequency of intense heat waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most regions. It's projected that heatwaves will lead to a $2 trillion loss in labor productivity by 2030. Additionally, marine heatwaves damage and kill coral reefs (which are worth $36 billion a year to the world economy), affecting tourism and the fishing industry and further contributing to the decline in GDP.\n\nIf appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures aren't taken, as global temperatures continue to rise we can expect a 7.2% cut to GDP per person worldwide and a 10.5% cut in the USA by 2100. Taking action now to cut emissions in line with the international Paris agreement could limit the loss to 1.1%, helping to protect the economy and people's livelihoods."

                      Ranked choice voting is a system which has been successfully employed to move past gridlock that comes with difficult issues, such as climate change, in a ‘winner takes all’ system. In a ranked choice system, voters rank all of the listed candidates from first to last instead of placing a single vote for one candidate. This allows voters to express their full range of support and incentivizes candidates to focus on creating strong platforms to address these issues to appeal to more voters. Ranked choice voting is gaining momentum across the country. It has been successfully implemented in St. Paul, Minneapolis, and St. Louis with a growing number of states and cities, such as New York City and California, adding it to their policy.


                      Climate change is one of the key issues that could benefit from this strategy in the form of more policy action. A study from the Yale program on Climate Change Communication found that 72% of moderate Democrats and 38% of moderate Republicans believe “global warming should be a high priority for the president and Congress”. While climate change continues to be seen as an important issue, using ranked choice voting could improve outcomes for climate policy as it influences candidates to broaden their platforms’ appeal.
                    shortDescription: Ranked choice voting ranks voters' preferences rather than voting for one person or party in a 'winner takes all' system. It encourages collaborations in campaigns and partnerships. It has been shown to help get past gridlock for challenging topics, including climate legislation.

                    Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), causing a death every 36 seconds. As of 2020, the CDC reports that there are approximately 805,000 heart attacks in the US every year. In 2014 and 2015, heart disease was found to cost the US $219 billion annually. Approximately half of the US population is exposed to one of the top risk factors for heart disease. These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. However, it is less known that exposure to air pollution can also increase the risk of heart disease.


                    This makes burning fossil fuels a contributor to not only climate change, but also heart disease. Numerous studies link air pollution exposure to heart disease, including one led by Dr. Joel Kaufman. Their study found that long term exposure can “prematurely age blood vessels and contribute to a more rapid buildup of calcium in the coronary artery”. This puts people at higher risk for heart attacks. With so many factors already influencing heart disease, shifting away from burning fossil fuels is necessary for protecting our health. And until we reach zero emissions from burning fossil fuels, citizens can stay healthier by monitoring air quality closer and avoiding exposure.


                    Increased high temperatures caused by climate change also put more strain on the body and increase the risk of heart attack, especially among the elderly.

Project Drawdown used forecasts of regional waste estimated from farm to household. This data shows that up to 35 percent of food in high-income economies is thrown out by consumers; in low-income economies, however, relatively little is wasted at the household level.

                      Despite 86% of Americans believing that climate change is a threat, Pew Research found that the issue ranked last at the 2020 election. Many people perceive climate change as an abstract issue that won’t affect them directly and climate action is often seen as being a direct threat to economic security or cultural identity.


                      To navigate this perception of threat, climate communicators stress the importance of ‘meeting people where they’re at’, getting to know their concerns, and framing climate change and climate action in relation to them. ‘Framing’ simply means understanding the concerns and values of who you are addressing, communicating how climate change impacts those issues, and presenting a frame and a pathway that shows how their concerns and values can be protected through climate action.


                      For example, many people worry that their livelihood will be threatened by economic pressures from climate action. Framing your conversation around fairness and equality can help resolve perceived tensions between economic security and climate action. By explaining potential transitionary policies, such as government funding for retraining, we can alleviate the perceived conflict between economic security and climate action. Furthermore, this framing shows how much they have to gain by being ecologically aware and politically involved within their community’s climate response.


                      Know your limits as a communicator and the limits of framing. Trust is vital in consensus building and it’s important to do what you can, where you can, on a regular basis rather than burning out on arguments. Additionally, research has shown that social influence is likely more important in decision-making than previously thought. By maximising your communication with as many people as possible, you can change the landscape of local climate discourse and engage the power of natural social networks to support climate communication and positive action, rather than hinder it.

Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9 trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion."

                    Global warming impacts increase the risk of damage to military bases. These impacts include more frequent floods, drought, wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and sea level rise. A 2019 US Defense Department report estimates two-thirds of military installations in the USA will be at risk in the next two decades. Including American territories and foreign nations, the US military has more than 300,000 buildings globally, many of which will be under threat from climate change impacts. Rebuilding and making bases more resilient is expensive. For example, in 2018 Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida was heavily damaged by Hurricane Michael and will cost at least $4.25 billion to rebuild.


                    This example illustrates how climate change is a threat to national security. So it's critical to implement actions that avert future damage and prevent the threat from worsening beyond control by reducing emissions as much as possible.

Paper products and organic wastes are treated in separate waste management solutions. Emissions reductions stem from avoiding emissions associated with landfilling and from substituting recycled materials for virgin feedstock. With about 50 percent of recycled materials coming from households and rest from industry, if the average worldwide recycling rate increases to 65-68 percent of total recyclable waste, household recycling could avoid 5.5-6.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

Managing leaks and disposal of these chemicals can avoid emissions in buildings and landfills. Substantial emissions reductions could be achieved through the adoption of practices to (1) avoid leaks from refrigerants and (2) destroy refrigerants at end of life, both after the adoption of alternatives to HFC refrigerants. Over thirty years, an increase of over 79% percent of refrigerants that may be released can be contained, avoiding emissions equivalent to 57.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Although some revenue can be generated from resale of recovered refrigerant gases, the costs to establish and operate recovery, destruction, and leak avoidance outweigh the financial benefit—meaning that refrigerant management, as modeled, could incur a net cost of $629.4 billion by 2050.

                    Breathing polluted air leads to increased risk of lung cancer. Smoking tobacco isn't the only thing that can cause lung cancer. Air pollution can too. In the US, 20% of people who die from lung cancer have never smoked or used tobacco. And globally, exposure to air pollution has been the fourth highest global mortality risk factor. Burning fossil fuels releases particulate matter (PM), which causes an increased risk for lung cancer under long term exposure. According to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), “global deaths attributable to ambient PM2.5 increased from 3.5 million in 1990 to 4.2 million in 2015.”


                    Particulate matter can also come from sources other than fossil fuels, such as from toxic smoke from wildfires that burn larger areas of land due to human-induced climate change.   Policies that limit heat-trapping gases are needed to prevent runaway climate change and to preserve our health and wellbeing by preventing the creation of toxic air pollution from burning fossil fuels.

                      Despite 86% of Americans believing that climate change is a threat, Pew Research found that the issue ranked last at the 2020 election. Many people perceive climate change as an abstract issue that won’t affect them directly and climate action is often seen as being a direct threat to economic security or cultural identity.


                      To navigate this perception of threat, climate communicators stress the importance of ‘meeting people where they’re at’, getting to know their concerns, and framing climate change and climate action in relation to them. ‘Framing’ simply means understanding the concerns and values of who you are addressing, communicating how climate change impacts those issues, and presenting a frame and a pathway that shows how their concerns and values can be protected through climate action.


                      For example, many people worry that their livelihood will be threatened by economic pressures from climate action. Framing your conversation around fairness and equality can help resolve perceived tensions between economic security and climate action. By explaining potential transitionary policies, such as government funding for retraining, we can alleviate the perceived conflict between economic security and climate action. Furthermore, this framing shows how much they have to gain by being ecologically aware and politically involved within their community’s climate response.


                      Know your limits as a communicator and the limits of framing. Trust is vital in consensus building and it’s important to do what you can, where you can, on a regular basis rather than burning out on arguments. Additionally, research has shown that social influence is likely more important in decision-making than previously thought. By maximising your communication with as many people as possible, you can change the landscape of local climate discourse and engage the power of natural social networks to support climate communication and positive action, rather than hinder it.

                    Recent years have seen record-shattering wildfires seasons. Although not the only factor, climate change is contributing to larger, more severe wildfires, and longer wildfire seasons. Warming temperatures and lower precipitation dry out vegetation and soils, allowing fuel to accumulate and making wildfires more likely. Estimates suggest human-caused climate change has doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984 and extended the wildfire season by 78 days relative to the 1970s—almost three additional months per year when a fire could start. Under conservative levels of future warming, 11 states in the U.S. are predicted to experience an increase of 200% or more in average burned area for 2010-2039 relative to 1961-2004 levels.


                    Increasing wildfire size and severity pose an enormous threat to animal and human life and property, as vividly demonstrated by the 2020 wildfires in places as disparate as California, Australia, and Brazil. This threat is compounded by increasing human development in fire-prone areas such as forest and chaparral habitats. Policies designed to prevent wildfires such as prescribed burns, which remove fuel from the landscape, can help mitigate this threat, as can individual actions including creating defensible space around homes and buildings. However, curbing the trend of increasing wildfire size and severity will likely require aggressive climate policy aimed at limiting the magnitude of future warming.

                    longDescription: "Under a cap and trade program, the government sets a 'cap' on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be emitted by any company or industry. The government then sells or issues permits (also known as allowances) to the emitters of greenhouse gases. Every emitter is required to have permits for each ton of GHGs they release into the atmosphere. If an emitter exceeds their allotted GHG amount, they can trade to buy more permits from the state or from businesses who have additional permits and are willing to sell them. \n\nOver time, the government lowers the number of available permits each year, thereby creating a scarcity which in turn increases the cost.  The increased cost every year forces the emitters to look either for cleaner alternatives or to reduce their emissions in other ways. This is how cap-and-trade programs lower the total amount of carbon emissions over time.\n\nAn example is  California’s cap-and-trade program, where GHG emissions have substantially reduced by over 13% since 2006. In return, Californian residents are benefiting from the emergence of new clean energy jobs and air quality improvement initiatives."
                    shortDescription: Setting a limit on emissions and creating a market for trading allowances drives down emissions by rewarding those who don't pollute and by limiting how much industries can pollute for free.

                    longDescription: Building on conservation agriculture with additional practices, regenerative annual cropping can include compost application, green manure, and organic production. It reduces emissions, increases soil organic matter, and sequesters carbon. From an estimated 11.84 million hectares of current adoption, Project Drawdown estimates regenerative annual cropping to increase to a total of 221-322 million hectares by 2050. This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration and reduced emissions. Regenerative annual cropping could provide a $2.3-3.5 trillion lifetime operational cost savings and lifetime net profit gain of $135-206 billion on an investment of $79-116 billion.

                    Corals depend on symbiotic algae (small marine 'plants' which live inside the corals) for energy. Global warming causes increases in ocean temperatures, which increase the frequency of marine heatwaves. These high temperatures stress corals and cause them to release the algae, so the corals become colourless and will die without algae. Half the world's reef systems have already been destroyed.


                    Coral reefs have the highest biodiversity of all marine ecosystems on the planet. They are important habitats for many fish species. Many people also highly value coral reefs for their beauty.  Corals come in a rich array of colours and shapes, and shelter a wide range of marine life from sea turtles to brightly-coloured clownfish and angelfish. Parrotfish graze on the reefs themselves, producing the fine white sand characteristic of tropical beaches.


                    Reefs are also valuable fishery grounds and tourist destinations. They help protect coastlines from erosion and storms. So as well as being of high intrinsic value, the loss of coral reefs threatens economies and leads to property damage.


                    Under climate change, marine heatwaves have doubled since 1982. If CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today. To protect our valuable coral reef systems, we need to act to reduce emissions now.

Though peatlands comprise only 3 percent of global land area, they are the most organic-rich soils; their degradation would release an enormous amount of carbon.

                      Deploying a carbon tax, whether locally or nationally, is a way to have companies or consumers pay a price for the amount of heat-trapping gases they produce, incentivizing them to reduce their emissions. Increasing the rate of carbon taxes encourages a faster shift away from burning fossil fuels and towards practices consistent with keeping global warming limited below catastrophic levels. According to the US Congressional Budget Office, a carbon tax of just $25 per ton would cause taxed emissions to be 11% lower than projected without a tax, and generate $1 trillion by 2028. The International Monetary Fund estimates a carbon tax of $75 per ton would lead to an emissions scenario which limits global warming to levels agreed upon by the Paris Agreement (2 degrees Celsius).


                      With the revenue generated from increased carbon taxes, investments can be made in climate-friendly initiatives or can be returned back to consumers to make the carbon tax revenue-neutral. Technologies such as those related to clean energy and emissions reduction can develop faster and increase the speed of the transition toward a sustainable future with more government investment. Money can also be directed to assist developing nations with their emissions or help marginalized communities with adapting to climate impacts that disproportionately affect them.

                    Climate is always changing. We have had ice ages and warmer periods when alligators were found in Spitzbergen. Ice ages have occurred in a hundred thousand year cycle for the last 700 thousand years, and there have been previous periods that appear to have been warmer than the present despite CO2 levels being lower than they are now. More recently, we have had the medieval warm period and the little ice age. (from Richard Lindzen)
                  mythRebuttal: Greenhouse gases, principally CO2, have controlled most ancient climate changes. This time around humans are the cause, mainly by our CO2 emissions.

            Tourism supports the livelihoods of an estimated one in ten people worldwide andaround 80% occurs around coastal destinations. Coral reefs are popular and exciting places for sightseeing, swimming, snorkelling, diving and boating. For example, Australia's Great Barrier Reef annually attracts 1.9 million visits, generates AUD$5.4 billion from tourism and supports 54,000 jobs. Florida's Coral Reef has an annual estimated tourism value of $1.1 billion and supports 71,000 jobs.


            Warming oceans due to climate change are causing increases in heatwaves occurring in the ocean (marine heatwaves). The frequency of these marine heatwaves has doubled since 1982, increasing coral bleaching and destruction. Already over 50% of coral reefs have been lost. If yearly CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today, causing over 97% of all coral reefs to die off along with much of the coastal marine life they support. The loss of coral reefs makes coastal destinations less attractive to tourists and negatively affects local economies.

It protects soil, avoids emissions, and sequesters carbon. \nBased on historic growth on large farming operations, the Project Drawdown analysis (see sources) projects the total area under conservation agriculture will continue growing from 148 million hectares to peak at 400-327 million hectares by 2035. Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9 trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion."

EVs always reduce car emissions—dramatically so when powered by renewable electricity. In 2018, 2 million electric cars were sold. If electric car ownership rises to 16-23 percent of total passenger km at a first cost of $4.5-5.8 trillion, by 2050, 11.9-15.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide from fuel combustion could be avoided as well as $15.3-21.8 trillion in fuel costs. Project Drawdown's analysis accounts for emissions from electricity generation and higher emissions of producing electric cars compared to internal-combustion cars. Electric cars are several thousand dollars more expensive, but Project Drawdown includes slightly declining electric cars prices, expected due to declining battery costs.

            A full grown bull Moose can reach 1,300 pounds and stand 6 ft tall at their shoulders, making a fine trophy for any sport hunter. These majestic creatures have evolved to live in colder climates. As heatwaves become more frequent and severe, these animals become heat-stressed and have access to less suitable habitat. By 2050, the total habitat for all mammals is expected to decline globally by 5%–16% of the 2015 level. This can be seen in Minnesota, where a decrease in moose population from 4,000 in 1983 to 100 in 2008 coincided with an average temperature increase of 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit.


            In addition to reduced habitat, warmer temperatures have enabled the increase in winter ticks. Moose have been found with 50,000 to 70,000 ticks (ten to twenty times more than normal). Ticks weaken the moose and leave them more susceptible to disease. As temperatures continue to rise, viewing and hunting opportunities will continue to decrease. Without intervention we could soon see the loss of this big-game animal.

            Climate change and rising temperatures are strongly linked to increasing suicide rates, threatening the stability of the future generation’s prosperity. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, “suicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34”, and the rates continue to climb. Studies have found that suicide rates increase by 0.7 percent in the United States when there is 1 degree Celsius of warming. Given the warming trends from our continued emissions of heat-trapping gases, Stanford researchers found “up to 21,000 additional suicides will occur by 2050 within the United States and Mexico” if significant action is not taken. A European study conducted in 2016 found climatic indicators to be a better predictor of suicide than socioeconomic factors after studying 29 countries over 13 years.


            Studies have found heat waves have the ability to affect our capacity to regulate our emotions, leading to other mental health issues such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in addition to suicide. Combatting these psychological effects is a national concern and requires serious investments in money and time. The Integrated Benefits Institute found that “for every 1,000 US employees, mood disorders in the workforce cost about $232,000 in excess health care treatments and lost work time”. Notably, availability of air conditioners does not prevent the impacts of heat on suicide. In addition to increased funding for suicide prevention, hospitals and other organizations can work to disseminate information on building individual resiliency behaviors. Investing in these preventative measures and addressing climate change could save thousands of lives from suicide alone.

Rising temperature and climate change are not direct motivations for suicide. Instead, temperature and climate increase the risk of suicide by affecting the likelihood that an individual situation leads to an attempt at self-harm.

              The rate of suicide, one of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, is increasing as global temperatures rise. While it is difficult to attribute this solely to rising temperatures due to the number of compounding factors, it is clear warming temperatures are disrupting mental health. Recent studies have found increasing temperatures can lead to more violence, stress, and decreased cognitive function which can result in suicide.


              Direct intervention methods, such as suicide hotlines, have proven effective at helping people with suicidal thoughts to change their minds. However, these and other research efforts for suicide are often underfunded relative to other public health issues like alcoholism or cancer. As climate change continues to impair our mental well-being, it is critical suicide prevention methods and services receive more funding to keep our communities safe.

Although the exact mix of alternatives is not projected and so the cost of adoption is not yet modeled, current and emerging refrigerants and appliances (including ammonia, carbon dioxide, and propane) can replace between 67%-82% of HFC refrigerants by 2050.

        - effectDescription: "Global warming has caused an increase in physical violence and conflict. For example, lower water reserves and agricultural yields result from a warming planet, forcing people to choose between migration or competition for resources. A study published in Nature estimates “climate has influenced between 3% and 20% of armed conflict risk over the last century”. And David Wallace-Wells claims, “for every half of a degree of warming, societies will see between 10 and 20 increase in the likelihood of armed conflict”. Other researchers, such as Solomon Hsiang and Marshall Burke, have tried to quantify the relationship between climate change and conflict, finding that “each rise in temperature or extreme rainfall by one standard variation increased the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14%.”\n\nThe Pentagon has even recognized the severity of this issue, warning Congress that it poses a national security issue. According to their staff it is a “threat multiplier” because climate change exacerbates the amount of violence surrounding existing threats such as hunger, poverty, and war. People's temperaments are more prone to be anxious and hostile at higher temperatures, where it becomes more difficult to make rational decisions. This is why increased temperatures are the leading cause of conflict in human interaction. As David-Wallace wells notes in his book, \"Heat frays everything. It increases violent crime rates, swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. The hotter it gets, the longer drivers will honk their horns in frustration; and even in simulations, police officers are more likely to fire on intruders when the exercises are conducted in hotter weather. By 2099, one speculative paper tabulated climate change in the US would bring about an additional 22,000 murders, 180,000 rapes, 3.5 million assaults, and 3.76 million robberies, burglaries, and acts of larceny.\" \n\nMigration is another outcome from climate disruption that can lead to violence. The World Bank estimates if we continue burning fossil fuels unabated there could be as many as 200 million climate migrants by 2050, seeking new areas to live when their home can no longer support their family from impacts such as sea level rise, extreme heat, fires, or drought. This means one out of every 45 people would be displaced by climate change. And studies have shown humanitarian crises such as forced migration, lead to an increase in violence against women. At the same time, protection against violence diminishes. With actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these vast migrations can be avoided by up to 80% according to the World Bank. To keep people safe, we must move society away from burning fossil fuels to avoid catastrophic climate change that increases physical violence globally."

Today, some 6.2 million Americans under the age of 18 suffer from asthma. Asthma is made worse by climate change in at least 3 ways: pollen, wildfire smoke, and ozone pollution.\n\nThe increase in carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels encourages faster plant growth, which has caused pollen levels to more than double since 1900. Pollen is expected to quadruple by 2060 compared to 1900 if society continues burning fossil fuels. The rate of asthma — which often occurs alongside pollen allergies — nearly tripled between 1980 and 2010. And researchers have found that global warming is also causing the pollen season to extend longer. The pollen season is now longer by two weeks on average across the U.S., and by at least four weeks in 34 cities. The largest changes have occurred in the West, with increases of two months or more in Bend, Oregon; Medford, Oregon; and Las Cruces, New Mexico. This means that plants that produce pollen, such as ragweed, certain kinds of grass, and trees are able to release more pollen for longer periods of time each year. This is resulting in frequent asthma attacks in people whose asthma are triggered by allergies.\n\nWe are also witnessing more frequent and intense wildfires due to climate change. Wildfires produce smoke that contains particulate matter. The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with development of asthma, especially in children and is also one of the causes of other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. \n\nLastly, hotter temperatures especially in urban areas is resulting in increased ground level ozone pollution. Ozone is typically associated with decreased lung functions, respiratory conditions like chronic pulmonary disease (COPD) and can trigger asthma attacks. \n\nFor all these reasons, climate change is a health emergency that demands immediate action globally to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible."

Climate change induces health effects that are varied and diverse, and include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, premature deaths due to extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food- and water-borne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health.


            Just 10 extreme events associated with climate change in 2012 cost the United States $1.6 billion in healthcare and lost wages, according to the National Resources Defense Council.  In total, these events, stretching from Washington to Florida, led to an estimated 917 deaths, more than 20,000 hospitalizations and nearly $10 billion (in 2018 dollars) in health-related costs. The two highest estimated costs events were for Hurricane Sandy at $3.2 billion and wildfires in Washington at $2.3 billion.

Though this is much lower than the available area for tropical forest restoration, it still sequesters 19.4-27.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050.

And in the past three years alone, the annual number of climate-related disasters costing over a billion dollars has doubled relative to the past; events are happening more frequently, with 28 of them occurring in 2018 and 2019 alone. These costly events often include large hurricanes, putting our coastal communities most at risk.\n\nWith the continued emissions of heat trapping gases by humans, we are driving oceans to warm, fueling more powerful hurricanes. Additionally, this warming is causing hurricanes to more frequently and rapidly intensify and sometimes even stall, where hurricanes grow in strength very quickly and then move very slowly over land, inflicting even more costly damage. \nAs of 2020, the five costliest hurricanes of all time each occurred after 2005 (Irma 2017, Sandy 2012, Maria 2017, Harvey 2017, Katrina 2005) and totaled $497 billion in associated losses. Human-induced climate change played a significant role in increasing these damages. For example, the warming from human heat-trapping emissions have made hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Maria drop upwards to 9 percent more rainfall, increasing flood damages. Reducing emissions and preparing our cities are key to keep our communities safe."

              Ranked choice voting is a system which has been successfully employed to move past gridlock that comes with difficult issues, such as climate change, in a ‘winner takes all’ system. In a ranked choice system, voters rank all of the listed candidates from first to last instead of placing a single vote for one candidate. This allows voters to express their full range of support and incentivizes candidates to focus on creating strong platforms to address these issues to appeal to more voters. Ranked choice voting is gaining momentum across the country. It has been successfully implemented in St. Paul, Minneapolis, and St. Louis with a growing number of states and cities, such as New York City and California, adding it to their policy.


              Climate change is one of the key issues that could benefit from this strategy in the form of more policy action. A study from the Yale program on Climate Change Communication found that 72% of moderate Democrats and 38% of moderate Republicans believe “global warming should be a high priority for the president and Congress”. While climate change continues to be seen as an important issue, using ranked choice voting could improve outcomes for climate policy as it influences candidates to broaden their platforms’ appeal.
            shortDescription: Ranked choice voting ranks voters' preferences rather than voting for one person or party in a 'winner takes all' system. It encourages collaborations in campaigns and partnerships. It has been shown to help get past gridlock for challenging topics, including climate legislation.

            More frequent heat waves due to climate change are disrupting students’ test scores, impacting their ability to achieve their goals. Studies show that as temperatures rise, our brain functions slow down. College students taking identical exams had an 11% lower chance of passing when the temperature was 90 degrees Fahrenheit compared to 72 degrees Fahrenheit.


            Air conditioning is a potential solution, but comes with its own challenges. For many people around the world air conditioning is unaffordable. For example,  87% of homes in the US have air conditioning compared to only 5% of homes in India. Even within the US access to air conditioning is not evenly distributed throughout society. School districts in wealthy areas have money to afford air conditioning, improving the test scores of their students and widening the education gap. Even with equitable air conditioning, the electrical consumption, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions, of more air conditioners need to be considered. Deploying solutions which fight climate change will help educate the students of tomorrow and allow them to achieve their goals and contribute to society.

              Air conditioning is necessary to avoid harm to people from extreme heat, especially in the tropics and as the climate warms further. However there is a tradeoff between human health and preventing greenhouse gas emissions, as air conditioning units are often powered by fossil fuel energy. In 2018 approximately 20% of electricity use in buildings was for air conditioning and fans worldwide, and this is increasing. Additionally, air conditioning uses HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants, which is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and can leak at any point during the lifecycle of an air conditioning unit, from manufacture to disposal.


              To prevent air conditioning from contributing to global warming, we need to use renewable energy to power air conditioners. This may require investing in cleaner technologies such as solar, wind and hydro power at large scale. We also need to develop and implement refrigerant alternatives to HFC.
            shortDescription: Air conditioning is necessary to reduce the deaths and other negative effects on the body from heatwaves. Powering additional units with renewable energy and using units with non-HFC refrigerants is also necessary to prevent additional emissions and reduce environmental impact.

              It is critical that human rights are always centered, that gender equality is the aim, and that benefits to the planet are understood as positive ripple effects of access and agency. Project Drawdown modeled the influence of two rights-based solutions on global population: universal education and family planning. Increased access to and quality of voluntary reproductive healthcare, family planning resources, and 12-13 years of schooling are essential components to achieve the United Nations’ 2015 medium global population projection of 9.7 billion people by 2050. If investment and support of these fundamental human rights-centered solutions does not materialize, the world’s population could come closer to the higher projection, adding another 1 billion people to the planet.


              Project Drawdown models the impact of this population difference in more-developed as well as least-and less-developed countries, in terms of how much energy, building space, food, waste, and transportation would be used. The resulting emissions reductions across the entire system could be as high as 85.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide, just within the window of 2020-2050. Health & Education have a compounding impact, however, with greater climate impacts into the future.

            High heat affects people's ability to concentrate and their health, causing lower labor productivity and employee absenteeism. This is an occupational health and safety issue and negatively affects the success of companies and their contribution to the economy.


            For every 1.8°F (1 °C) rise in temperatures above 77°F (25°C) there is an average 2% decrease in work performance. This is due to both physiological and cognitive impairment caused by heat exhaustion and dehydration, and a higher risk of injury. High heat negatively affects people in offices with no or inadequate air conditioning, and those working outside such as agriculture, construction and logistics workers. People are also more likely to stay home during heat waves, with resulting loss of income. To make up for reduced output, workers have to work longer hours or more workers have to be hired, both of which cause higher costs to the organization.


            Human-caused climate change is already having impacts on worker productivity. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most regions.

              Carbon taxes, where organizations are charged based on the amount of carbon pollution they emit, have long been talked about as a way to spark a shift to more sustainable ways of living. Globally they are gaining momentum as one of the primary ways to address anthropogenic emissions. Over 3,500 economists, including 27 Nobel laureates, have signed a statement which said a carbon tax was “the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary.”


              Elected officials in US Congress have been working on a revenue-neutral carbon tax which redistributes the income from the carbon tax back to taxpayers as a way to increase adoption. The preliminary analysis shows that this strategy would not have any major impact on economic growth. In fact, in 2017 the Treasury Department found this strategy would see the income increase in two-thirds of American households. Columbia University economists estimate that every adult with a Social Security number would receive up to $275 a month by 2030. Their study also projected an emissions reduction of 40% within a decade.

This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration and reduced emissions. Regenerative annual cropping could provide a $2.3-3.5 trillion lifetime operational cost savings and lifetime net profit gain of $135-206 billion on an investment of $79-116 billion.

            A Harvard study analyzing 21 million test scores from 10 million PSAT takers, who took the exam multiple times, found that for schools without air conditioning, a temperature increase of 1 degrees Fahrenheit for the year corresponds to a 1% decrease in amount learned. This problem of hotter classrooms is exacerbated further for minority students who tend to live in warmer climates. Hotter temperatures can be mitigated with air conditioning but many schools struggle to maintain their yearly budgets and adding air conditioners to every classroom is a major expense. Furthermore, air conditioners soak up a lot of power, which in turn means more emissions, resulting in more warming if renewable energy is not used.

              Air conditioning is necessary to avoid harm to people from extreme heat, especially in the tropics and as the climate warms further. However there is a tradeoff between human health and preventing greenhouse gas emissions, as air conditioning units are often powered by fossil fuel energy. In 2018 approximately 20% of electricity use in buildings was for air conditioning and fans worldwide, and this is increasing. Additionally, air conditioning uses HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants, which is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and can leak at any point during the lifecycle of an air conditioning unit, from manufacture to disposal.


              To prevent air conditioning from contributing to global warming, we need to use renewable energy to power air conditioners. This may require investing in cleaner technologies such as solar, wind and hydro power at large scale. We also need to develop and implement refrigerant alternatives to HFC.
            shortDescription: Air conditioning is necessary to reduce the deaths and other negative effects on the body from heatwaves. Powering additional units with renewable energy and using units with non-HFC refrigerants is also necessary to prevent additional emissions and reduce environmental impact.

            longDescription: "People are developing technology that can capture carbon from the air to help reduce emissions as we transition to a more sustainable future. These “carbon capture” technologies come in two main forms. The first is a filtering technology which removes the carbon dioxide directly from emissions as they are produced at power plants or factories. The second is called “direct air capture” which pulls out carbon dioxide that is already in the air. Once this carbon is captured, it can be stored underground or converted into a carbon-containing product. \n\nCarbon capture is seen as a vital part of the transition to a carbon neutral economy. According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the deployment of carbon capture and storage is a key part of most of the mitigation pathways to limit future global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Currently only 30 megatonnes of carbon is captured each year. The International Energy Agency expects carbon capture to reach 2,300 megatonnes per year by 2040, which correlates to a seven percent reduction in global emissions. Policies can be implemented which help bring these technologies to market, such as setting higher carbon prices for existing emissions compared to those not in the air yet. However, it is important that these policies create incentive structures that not only alleviate the uncertainty around development and deployment of this technology but also do not encourage continued fossil fuel use alongside it."
            shortDescription: Similar to trees, humans can artificially capture carbon dioxide from sources of emissions or directly from the air. The carbon is then locked away long term by injecting it deep underground or converting it into products such as fuel, concrete or soap.

Managing leaks and disposal of these chemicals can avoid emissions in buildings and landfills. Substantial emissions reductions could be achieved through the adoption of practices to (1) avoid leaks from refrigerants and (2) destroy refrigerants at end of life, both after the adoption of alternatives to HFC refrigerants. Over thirty years, an increase of over 79% percent of refrigerants that may be released can be contained, avoiding emissions equivalent to 57.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Although some revenue can be generated from resale of recovered refrigerant gases, the costs to establish and operate recovery, destruction, and leak avoidance outweigh the financial benefit—meaning that refrigerant management, as modeled, could incur a net cost of $629.4 billion by 2050.

            A hotter climate will mean more frequent and severe flooding, affecting all cities and land  which experience rain or are by the sea.


            Every 1°F rise in average temperature allows the air to hold 4% more water. This means when it rains it can release more water than previously possible. Hurricanes become worse because not only can their clouds hold more water than before, warmer oceans allow hurricanes to become even larger with stronger wind speeds, and enables them to sit on top of cities for longer periods of time. Additionally, climate change is making our usual weather cycles more unusual and unpredictable, meaning that both dry seasons and wet seasons will be intensified. Additionally, sea level rise driven by melting ice caps is flooding coastal areas. All of these mean that once in a lifetime events like droughts, hurricanes, and floods are becoming increasingly common events, and will overwhelm our existing infrastructure.


            Flooding destroys both lives and property, ruins entire crops, and causes sewage and farm runoff to contaminate living areas and water supplies. The loss of clean water supplies leads to outbreaks of usually easily preventable disease, like diarrhoeal diseases which already kill around half a million children every year.


            Many vulnerable areas of the United States (as well as other developed countries) are seeing significant residential and commercial development despite the long-term flood risks.  Nationally, the number of Americans living in these high-flood-risk areas in 2016 climbed 14 percent compared to those living in the same neighborhoods in 2000. That’s actually faster than in areas outside of flood zones, where the population increased 13 percent. The United States is spending billions every year to move people into flood-prone areas and keep people living in flood-prone areas. Research shows upwards to 75 percent of people who live in high-risk flood areas in North America are not even aware they are at risk for flooding.


            In the USA, FEMA spent approximately $48.6 billion to repair or replace public infrastructure such as roads, bridges and utilities between 1998 and 2014. The National Flood Insurance Program paid $2.9 billion per year to citizens for flood-related losses between 2007 and 2017. These costs will only rise as climate change gets more extreme. Climate scientists have estimated that by 2100 somewhere between 17 and 210 trillion dollars worth of assets will be at flood risk due to rising sea levels, requiring massive investments in flood protection to mitigate disasters annually. Not taking responsibility for our climate now means paying more in lives and resources in the future.

This solution is much easier to implement for new construction. For existing properties, government programs exist which can aid the transition to building outside floodplains.

Cases of heat-related illness have grown by 60% for active-duty service members, with the US Defense Health Agency reporting an increase from 1,751 cases in 2014 to 2,792 in 2018. Shockingly only 67 of those cases are from troops abroad in Iraq or Afghanistan, with the majority occurring in the US. Not all troops are affected equally. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch found that younger personnel under 20 years of age make up three times as many heat related illness cases as the folks who are 20-24 years old. Additionally, Asian, Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic black service members experience higher rates of heat-related illness.


            With no action taken to reduce global warming, military installations in the US could experience five times as many days with a heat index above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. This equates to an average additional 33 days per year. Some bases would experience even greater extremes. For example, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona could experience an additional 17 days per year with a heat index above 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

It protects soil, avoids emissions, and sequesters carbon. \nBased on historic growth on large farming operations, the Project Drawdown analysis (see sources) projects the total area under conservation agriculture will continue growing from 148 million hectares to peak at 400-327 million hectares by 2035. Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9 trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion."

            Air pollution refers to any pollutant in the air which can harm human health. Over time, the amount of pollution in the air has increased due to human activity, disproportionately affecting the wellbeing of children. A large part of a child’s lung develops after birth. Because of this, exposure to increased levels of pollution puts children at a greater risk of reduced lung growth, respiratory infections, and developing future chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease. According to CNN, “around 93% of the world’s children under 15 years of age breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk”. CNN reports that in 2016 alone, 600,000 children were estimated to have died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air.”


            Studies have been conducted which show that reducing air pollution can protect against these harmful impacts. A 2016 report looked at children living in Southern California across three separate time periods (1993-2001, 1996-2004, 2003-2012) and found the children living during periods of better air quality suffered fewer bronchial symptoms. The WHO recommends policies such as the use of renewable energy to curb emissions to improve air quality and help secure children’s futures around the world.

For example, coal mining is a polluting sector that has declined in the US. In West Virginia, mining jobs have declined nearly three times faster than the decline in coal production. Encouraging miners to move into climate-friendly sectors such as renewable energy reduces the risk of unemployment and often provides better pay.\n\nHowever, government investment in re-training, job creation, and new technologies may be needed to achieve a successful transition to a green economy. This requires a national green job program involving educational institutes, private companies and research and development teams, coordinated and supported by the federal government."

            There are several examples globally where minorities are being disproportionately affected by climate change. For example, in the United States the prevalence of childhood asthma among Puerto Ricans (19.2%) or non-Hispanic blacks (12.7%) is higher than non-Hispanic whites (8%) or Mexican Americans (6.4%). Asthma mortality rates in children and adults are nearly eightfold and threefold higher, respectively, in non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites. Climate change impacts such as increased pollen can increase asthma rates.


            Another example is African-Americans being disproportionately flooded by hurricanes, like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Within the city itself, 80 per cent of people who had lived in the flooded areas were non-white. Escaping the stricken city was harder for people in the flooded areas, because one in five of them had no access to a car, compared to one in ten without access in the dry areas. Climate change is increasing the frequency of hurricanes and flooding

            Stroke is the number one cause of motor disabilities and the second cause of cognitive disorder and death worldwide. Air pollution is a causal factor in 30% of strokes and 21% of deaths from stroke. Particulate matter air pollutants make brain cells more likely to die when a stroke occurs. There is also evidence that air pollutants make blood inside blood vessels more likely to clot, causing strokes when those clots are dislodged, caught in the brain, and then block blood flow to the brain. This reduces the oxygen supply to brain cells, which then die and cause motor disabilities or death.


            A warmer climate makes strokes worse. Burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases that drive a warming climate which significantly raises the risk for stroke. When the air pollution from burning fossil fuels meet higher temperatures, they produce ground-level ozone, a polluting gas, and smog. Climate change makes these air pollutants more toxic and exposure to them short term and long term increases the risk of stroke. Additionally, high temperatures dry out vegetation, increasing the frequency and ferocity of wildfires, and producing more ash and smoke pollution called particulate matter that also worsen stroke risk.


            This demonstrates how climate change and the continued burning of fossil fuels cause health emergencies, and we need to act now to protect ourselves and our loved ones.

Studies indicate an average 2% decrease in work performance per °C temperature rise (1.8° F) when the temperature is above 25°C (77°F). \n\nThe frequency of intense heat waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most regions. It's projected that heatwaves will lead to a $2 trillion loss in labor productivity by 2030. Additionally, marine heatwaves damage and kill coral reefs (which are worth $36 billion a year to the world economy), affecting tourism and the fishing industry and further contributing to the decline in GDP.\n\nIf appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures aren't taken, as global temperatures continue to rise we can expect a 7.2% cut to GDP per person worldwide and a 10.5% cut in the USA by 2100. Taking action now to cut emissions in line with the international Paris agreement could limit the loss to 1.1%, helping to protect the economy and people's livelihoods."

              Ranked choice voting is a system which has been successfully employed to move past gridlock that comes with difficult issues, such as climate change, in a ‘winner takes all’ system. In a ranked choice system, voters rank all of the listed candidates from first to last instead of placing a single vote for one candidate. This allows voters to express their full range of support and incentivizes candidates to focus on creating strong platforms to address these issues to appeal to more voters. Ranked choice voting is gaining momentum across the country. It has been successfully implemented in St. Paul, Minneapolis, and St. Louis with a growing number of states and cities, such as New York City and California, adding it to their policy.


              Climate change is one of the key issues that could benefit from this strategy in the form of more policy action. A study from the Yale program on Climate Change Communication found that 72% of moderate Democrats and 38% of moderate Republicans believe “global warming should be a high priority for the president and Congress”. While climate change continues to be seen as an important issue, using ranked choice voting could improve outcomes for climate policy as it influences candidates to broaden their platforms’ appeal.
            shortDescription: Ranked choice voting ranks voters' preferences rather than voting for one person or party in a 'winner takes all' system. It encourages collaborations in campaigns and partnerships. It has been shown to help get past gridlock for challenging topics, including climate legislation.

            Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), causing a death every 36 seconds. As of 2020, the CDC reports that there are approximately 805,000 heart attacks in the US every year. In 2014 and 2015, heart disease was found to cost the US $219 billion annually. Approximately half of the US population is exposed to one of the top risk factors for heart disease. These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. However, it is less known that exposure to air pollution can also increase the risk of heart disease.


            This makes burning fossil fuels a contributor to not only climate change, but also heart disease. Numerous studies link air pollution exposure to heart disease, including one led by Dr. Joel Kaufman. Their study found that long term exposure can “prematurely age blood vessels and contribute to a more rapid buildup of calcium in the coronary artery”. This puts people at higher risk for heart attacks. With so many factors already influencing heart disease, shifting away from burning fossil fuels is necessary for protecting our health. And until we reach zero emissions from burning fossil fuels, citizens can stay healthier by monitoring air quality closer and avoiding exposure.


            Increased high temperatures caused by climate change also put more strain on the body and increase the risk of heart attack, especially among the elderly.

Reducing waste also avoids the deforestation for additional farmland, preventing 74.9-76.3 gigatons of additional emissions. Project Drawdown used forecasts of regional waste estimated from farm to household.

              Despite 86% of Americans believing that climate change is a threat, Pew Research found that the issue ranked last at the 2020 election. Many people perceive climate change as an abstract issue that won’t affect them directly and climate action is often seen as being a direct threat to economic security or cultural identity.


              To navigate this perception of threat, climate communicators stress the importance of ‘meeting people where they’re at’, getting to know their concerns, and framing climate change and climate action in relation to them. ‘Framing’ simply means understanding the concerns and values of who you are addressing, communicating how climate change impacts those issues, and presenting a frame and a pathway that shows how their concerns and values can be protected through climate action.


              For example, many people worry that their livelihood will be threatened by economic pressures from climate action. Framing your conversation around fairness and equality can help resolve perceived tensions between economic security and climate action. By explaining potential transitionary policies, such as government funding for retraining, we can alleviate the perceived conflict between economic security and climate action. Furthermore, this framing shows how much they have to gain by being ecologically aware and politically involved within their community’s climate response.


              Know your limits as a communicator and the limits of framing. Trust is vital in consensus building and it’s important to do what you can, where you can, on a regular basis rather than burning out on arguments. Additionally, research has shown that social influence is likely more important in decision-making than previously thought. By maximising your communication with as many people as possible, you can change the landscape of local climate discourse and engage the power of natural social networks to support climate communication and positive action, rather than hinder it.
            shortDescription: Tailoring your climate change message about topics or values important to people makes for a more positive and effective conversation.

Over thirty years, an increase of over 79% percent of refrigerants that may be released can be contained, avoiding emissions equivalent to 57.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Although some revenue can be generated from resale of recovered refrigerant gases, the costs to establish and operate recovery, destruction, and leak avoidance outweigh the financial benefit—meaning that refrigerant management, as modeled, could incur a net cost of $629.4 billion by 2050.

            Breathing polluted air leads to increased risk of lung cancer. Smoking tobacco isn't the only thing that can cause lung cancer. Air pollution can too. In the US, 20% of people who die from lung cancer have never smoked or used tobacco. And globally, exposure to air pollution has been the fourth highest global mortality risk factor. Burning fossil fuels releases particulate matter (PM), which causes an increased risk for lung cancer under long term exposure. According to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), “global deaths attributable to ambient PM2.5 increased from 3.5 million in 1990 to 4.2 million in 2015.”


            Particulate matter can also come from sources other than fossil fuels, such as from toxic smoke from wildfires that burn larger areas of land due to human-induced climate change.   Policies that limit heat-trapping gases are needed to prevent runaway climate change and to preserve our health and wellbeing by preventing the creation of toxic air pollution from burning fossil fuels.

              Despite 86% of Americans believing that climate change is a threat, Pew Research found that the issue ranked last at the 2020 election. Many people perceive climate change as an abstract issue that won’t affect them directly and climate action is often seen as being a direct threat to economic security or cultural identity.


              To navigate this perception of threat, climate communicators stress the importance of ‘meeting people where they’re at’, getting to know their concerns, and framing climate change and climate action in relation to them. ‘Framing’ simply means understanding the concerns and values of who you are addressing, communicating how climate change impacts those issues, and presenting a frame and a pathway that shows how their concerns and values can be protected through climate action.


              For example, many people worry that their livelihood will be threatened by economic pressures from climate action. Framing your conversation around fairness and equality can help resolve perceived tensions between economic security and climate action. By explaining potential transitionary policies, such as government funding for retraining, we can alleviate the perceived conflict between economic security and climate action. Furthermore, this framing shows how much they have to gain by being ecologically aware and politically involved within their community’s climate response.


              Know your limits as a communicator and the limits of framing. Trust is vital in consensus building and it’s important to do what you can, where you can, on a regular basis rather than burning out on arguments. Additionally, research has shown that social influence is likely more important in decision-making than previously thought. By maximising your communication with as many people as possible, you can change the landscape of local climate discourse and engage the power of natural social networks to support climate communication and positive action, rather than hinder it.
            shortDescription: Tailoring your climate change message about topics or values important to people makes for a more positive and effective conversation.

            Recent years have seen record-shattering wildfires seasons. Although not the only factor, climate change is contributing to larger, more severe wildfires, and longer wildfire seasons. Warming temperatures and lower precipitation dry out vegetation and soils, allowing fuel to accumulate and making wildfires more likely. Estimates suggest human-caused climate change has doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984 and extended the wildfire season by 78 days relative to the 1970s—almost three additional months per year when a fire could start. Under conservative levels of future warming, 11 states in the U.S. are predicted to experience an increase of 200% or more in average burned area for 2010-2039 relative to 1961-2004 levels.


            Increasing wildfire size and severity pose an enormous threat to animal and human life and property, as vividly demonstrated by the 2020 wildfires in places as disparate as California, Australia, and Brazil. This threat is compounded by increasing human development in fire-prone areas such as forest and chaparral habitats. Policies designed to prevent wildfires such as prescribed burns, which remove fuel from the landscape, can help mitigate this threat, as can individual actions including creating defensible space around homes and buildings. However, curbing the trend of increasing wildfire size and severity will likely require aggressive climate policy aimed at limiting the magnitude of future warming.

People can do it by hand also, but hiring a herd of goats is a cheaper alternative, costing 28 times less ($28,000 vs $1000 per acre in California). These hardy climbers can climb steep slopes and access hard to reach areas where people and machines can't go.

            longDescription: "Under a cap and trade program, the government sets a 'cap' on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be emitted by any company or industry. The government then sells or issues permits (also known as allowances) to the emitters of greenhouse gases. Every emitter is required to have permits for each ton of GHGs they release into the atmosphere. If an emitter exceeds their allotted GHG amount, they can trade to buy more permits from the state or from businesses who have additional permits and are willing to sell them. \n\nOver time, the government lowers the number of available permits each year, thereby creating a scarcity which in turn increases the cost.  The increased cost every year forces the emitters to look either for cleaner alternatives or to reduce their emissions in other ways. This is how cap-and-trade programs lower the total amount of carbon emissions over time.\n\nAn example is  California’s cap-and-trade program, where GHG emissions have substantially reduced by over 13% since 2006. In return, Californian residents are benefiting from the emergence of new clean energy jobs and air quality improvement initiatives."
            shortDescription: Setting a limit on emissions and creating a market for trading allowances drives down emissions by rewarding those who don't pollute and by limiting how much industries can pollute for free.

This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration and reduced emissions.

            Corals depend on symbiotic algae (small marine 'plants' which live inside the corals) for energy. Global warming causes increases in ocean temperatures, which increase the frequency of marine heatwaves. These high temperatures stress corals and cause them to release the algae, so the corals become colourless and will die without algae. Half the world's reef systems have already been destroyed.


            Coral reefs have the highest biodiversity of all marine ecosystems on the planet. They are important habitats for many fish species. Many people also highly value coral reefs for their beauty.  Corals come in a rich array of colours and shapes, and shelter a wide range of marine life from sea turtles to brightly-coloured clownfish and angelfish. Parrotfish graze on the reefs themselves, producing the fine white sand characteristic of tropical beaches.


            Reefs are also valuable fishery grounds and tourist destinations. They help protect coastlines from erosion and storms. So as well as being of high intrinsic value, the loss of coral reefs threatens economies and leads to property damage.


            Under climate change, marine heatwaves have doubled since 1982. If CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today. To protect our valuable coral reef systems, we need to act to reduce emissions now.

              Deploying a carbon tax, whether locally or nationally, is a way to have companies or consumers pay a price for the amount of heat-trapping gases they produce, incentivizing them to reduce their emissions. Increasing the rate of carbon taxes encourages a faster shift away from burning fossil fuels and towards practices consistent with keeping global warming limited below catastrophic levels. According to the US Congressional Budget Office, a carbon tax of just $25 per ton would cause taxed emissions to be 11% lower than projected without a tax, and generate $1 trillion by 2028. The International Monetary Fund estimates a carbon tax of $75 per ton would lead to an emissions scenario which limits global warming to levels agreed upon by the Paris Agreement (2 degrees Celsius).


              With the revenue generated from increased carbon taxes, investments can be made in climate-friendly initiatives or can be returned back to consumers to make the carbon tax revenue-neutral. Technologies such as those related to clean energy and emissions reduction can develop faster and increase the speed of the transition toward a sustainable future with more government investment. Money can also be directed to assist developing nations with their emissions or help marginalized communities with adapting to climate impacts that disproportionately affect them.
            shortDescription: Increasing carbon taxes encourages greater reduction in emissions and can provide funds for investment in climate-friendly projects.

          Tourism supports the livelihoods of an estimated one in ten people worldwide andaround 80% occurs around coastal destinations. Coral reefs are popular and exciting places for sightseeing, swimming, snorkelling, diving and boating. For example, Australia's Great Barrier Reef annually attracts 1.9 million visits, generates AUD$5.4 billion from tourism and supports 54,000 jobs. Florida's Coral Reef has an annual estimated tourism value of $1.1 billion and supports 71,000 jobs.


          Warming oceans due to climate change are causing increases in heatwaves occurring in the ocean (marine heatwaves). The frequency of these marine heatwaves has doubled since 1982, increasing coral bleaching and destruction. Already over 50% of coral reefs have been lost. If yearly CO2 emissions aren't reduced, in the future these heatwaves will occur 50 times more often than they do today, causing over 97% of all coral reefs to die off along with much of the coastal marine life they support. The loss of coral reefs makes coastal destinations less attractive to tourists and negatively affects local economies.

Project Drawdown's projection for carpooling focuses on approaches to increase global urban car occupancy, the number of passengers in each car trip. They assume that urban car occupancy can rise from 1.57 in 2018 to 1.75 or 2.0 by 2050, assuming 3 passengers per carpool trip. Carpooling has no implementation costs and can reduce emissions by 4.2-7.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide while saving $2.8-$5.2 trillion in operating costs.
          shortDescription: Sharing car rides with friends or colleagues reduces the number of cars on the road. Carpooling can reduce emissions by at most 7.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide while saving up to $5.2 trillion in costs.

It protects soil, avoids emissions, and sequesters carbon. \nBased on historic growth on large farming operations, the Project Drawdown analysis (see sources) projects the total area under conservation agriculture will continue growing from 148 million hectares to peak at 400-327 million hectares by 2035. Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9 trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion."

EVs always reduce car emissions—dramatically so when powered by renewable electricity. In 2018, 2 million electric cars were sold. If electric car ownership rises to 16-23 percent of total passenger km at a first cost of $4.5-5.8 trillion, by 2050, 11.9-15.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide from fuel combustion could be avoided as well as $15.3-21.8 trillion in fuel costs. Project Drawdown's analysis accounts for emissions from electricity generation and higher emissions of producing electric cars compared to internal-combustion cars. Electric cars are several thousand dollars more expensive, but Project Drawdown includes slightly declining electric cars prices, expected due to declining battery costs.
