## Who we are?

This REST API repository is a part of a [Climate Mind project](https://climatemind.org/). The project motivation, history and target audience could be found on [this page](https://contribute.climatemind.org/v/about-the-project/). Our current team and people who worked on the previous version are [listed on our website](https://climatemind.org/#team).

## What we are doing?

Our [web application](https://app-frontend-prod-001.azurewebsites.net/) makes conversations about climate change easier, by letting users explore climate issues that speak to their personal values. In other words, you'll know how to start a good conversation about the most scarifying topic of our time and don't screw up by looking paranoid. See [web app documentation](https://docs.climatemind.org/) for the application's detailed overview.
