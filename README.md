# Climatemind Backend

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

This project uses Docker. Install it through their website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

**_Before doing what's below, be sure the Docker application is running and the command line working directory is changed to the climatemind-backend path._**

## Running the application with Docker Compose (for development)

Windows users - you may experience problems with building or starting the containers if your system automatically converts Unix line endings ('\n') to DOS line endings ('\r\n'). You can prevent this from happening by running the command below. 

    git config --global core.autocrlf false

Build the image container to download and install code dependencies needed for running the app using the build command below.

**_SPECIAL NOTE_**: _Whenever the backend repo has added new dependancies in the requirements.txt file the docker image will need to be re-built by re-running the build command._

    docker-compose build

Start in foreground (good for debugging flask and see the logs). You can stop it with [CTRL + C] on OSX, Windows, and Linux.

    docker-compose up

Start in background (best for when trying to visualize the ontology)

    docker-compose up -d

Stop the container when running in the background. Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by docker-compose up.

    docker-compose down

**_SPECIAL NOTE_**: _Sometimes the terminal says 'Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000' and that url does not work in the browser. If this happens, try going to "http://127.0.0.1:5000" instead._

## Running the application with Docker (for deployment)

The Docker lifecycle is to build the image and run it only once. After that you can stop or start the image.

Building Docker image

    docker build -t "climatemind-backend:0.1" .

Checking the built image

    docker images climatemind-backend

Running Docker

    docker run -d --name climatemind-backend --publish 5000:5000 climatemind-backend:0.1

Stop the container

    docker stop climatemind-backend

Start the container

    docker start climatemind-backend

## Api documentation

[Swagger Documentation](http://localhost:5000/swagger) is available, detailing the API endpoints and how they should be used. Whilst in development this can be found at [http://localhost:5000/swagger](http://localhost:5000/swagger).

## Processing a new Climate Mind OWL ontology file

Follow these instructions to process a new version of a Climate Mind ontology OWL file into files used by Climate Mind (such as Networkx pickle file, test ontology JSON, edge list output CSV, etc).

1. Download the new OWL ontology file (if haven't already) and put it in the proper place:
    * Download the OWL ontology file by going to webprotege.stanford.edu and downloading in the format 'RDF/XML'. (If you don't have access, simply email hello@climatemind.org with your webprotege username to get access). 
    * Unzip the download and go into the folder and move/copy the single ontology file to the folder in the climatemind-backend directory folder named 'PUT_NEW_OWL_FILE_IN_HERE'

2. Change the directory to be the climatemind-backend by using the following command. The part in caps should be replaced with the path to climatemind-backend on your system (for mac):

   for OSX: `cd PATH_TO_CLIMATEMIND-BACKEND`

3. Remove any pre-existing docker container, build the new docker container, and start the new container in developer mode by running the following:

    ```
        docker-compose down
        docker-compose build
        docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
4. Store the docker container id as a variable by doing:
    * FOR MAC/LINUX:
    ```
        CLIMATEMIND_ID=$(docker ps -lq)
    ```
    * FOR PC with powershell:
    ```
        $CLIMATEMIND_ID=$(docker ps -lq)
    ```

5. Process the OWL file either without the visualization app being triggered (OPTION A) or with visualization being triggered (OPTION B)

    * OPTION A. Do this option for processing the new OWL file _without_ visualizing it after it's done processing: From the climatemind-backend directory run process_new_ontology_file.py using the climatemind docker image running in the background. Note: New files will be generated and appear in the climatemind-backend directory. These files are also listed in the git.ignore file, so don't worry about them getting pushed accidentally to the git repo.

        for OSX, run this *exactly* as below:
    ```
        docker exec -it $CLIMATEMIND_ID python process_new_ontology_file.py
    ```

    * OPTION B. Do this option for processing the new OWL file _with_ visualizing it after it's done processing. Follow these instructions to visualize an OWL file using the Dash dashboard generated by the visualize.py script:  From the climatemind-backend directory run the process_new_ontology_and_visualize.py using the climatemind docker image running in the background. Note: New files will be generated and appear in the climatemind-backend directory. These files are also listed in the git.ignore file, so don't worry about them getting pushed accidentally to the git repo.

        for OSX or PC with powershell, run this *exactly* as below:
    ```
        docker exec -it $CLIMATEMIND_ID python process_new_ontology_and_visualize.py
    ```

## Database
[Flask migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used to handle database structure migrations. 
Whenever the data model changes, you need to manually run `flask db migrate -m "Name of migration"`
This will generate a file under `/migrations/version` which then should be checked into GIT. Whenever the API starts up, it calls `flask db upgrade`. This command will automatically apply any new migrations to the database. No manual scripts or post release commands are required!

## Extra details if the visualization script directly above was started.

6. After running step 3 OPTION B above, find the URL that appears in the terminal and go to it in your internet browser.

    Example: "Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/" appears in the terminal, so go to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your internet browser.


7. Use the visualization dashboard in your internet browser.

8. When done using the dashboard, close the browser and stop the script from running by going to the terminal and pressing [CTRL + C]

## Code Style
The Python code style is formatted using [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/). Black is a file formatter that converts your code to follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards. PEP 8 provides guidelines and best practices for writing Python, and is the standard style used for modern Python libraries. 

Install Black by running `pip install black`. Note: Python 3.6.0+ is required.

Cd into the climatemind-backend directory on your computer to run black commands.

Run Black locally to see which files need formatting using `python3 -m black --check ./`

Use Black to automatically format your files using `python3 -m black ./`
