      Regardless, it converts organic waste into soil carbon, averting landfill methane
      emissions in the process. In 2015, an estimated 38 percent of food waste was
      composted in the United States; 57 percent was composted in the European Union.
      If all lower-income countries reached the U.S. rate and all higher-income countries
      achieved the E.U. rate, composting could avoid methane emissions from landfills
      equivalent to 2.1-3.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050. That total excludes
      additional gains from applying compost to soil. Compost facilities cost less
      to construct but more to operate, which is reflected in the financial results.'']'

  eating lower down the foodchain (plant-rich diets):

    comment: "['Consumption of meat and dairy, as well as overall calories, often\
      \ exceeds nutritional recommendations. Paring down and favoring plant-based\
      \ foods reduces demand, thereby reducing land clearing, fertilizer use, burping\
      \ cattle, and greenhouse gas emissions. Using country-level data from the Food\
      \ and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Project Drawdown estimates\
      \ the growth in global food consumption by 2050, assuming that lower-income\
      \ countries will consume more food overall and higher quantities of meat as\
      \ economies grow. If 50-75 percent of the world\u2019s population restricts\
      \ their diet to a healthy average 2,250 calories per day and reduces meat consumption\
      \ overall, Project Drawdown estimates at least 43-68 gigatons of emissions could\
      \ be avoided from dietary change alone. If avoided deforestation from land use\
      \ change is included, an additional 21.8-23.5 gigatons of emissions could be\
      \ avoided, making healthy, plant-rich diets one of the most impactful solutions\
      \ at a total of 64.8-91.5 gigatons avoided.']"

    comment: '["Bamboo rapidly sequesters carbon in biomass and soil and can thrive
      on degraded lands. Long-lived bamboo products can also store carbon over time.
      \nBamboo is planted on 33.52 million hectares today. We assume that it will
      be grown on an additional 69.8-174.3 million hectares of degraded forest lands.
      Project Drawdown''s carbon sequestration calculations include both living biomass
      and long-lived bamboo products, with an annual rate of 2.03 tons of carbon per
      hectare, resulting in a total of 8.3-21.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide sequestered
      by 2050. An initial investment of $52-162 billion and lifetime operational cost
      of $566-1444 billion could yield a lifetime net profit of $1707-4348 billion.
      When bamboo is substituted for aluminum, concrete, plastic, or steel, there
      can be significant avoided emissions; however, these additional benefits are
      not included."]'

  increase in conservation agriculture:

    comment: '[''Conservation agriculture uses cover crops, crop rotation, and minimal
      tilling in the production of annual crops. It protects soil, avoids emissions,
      and sequesters carbon. \nBased on historic growth on large farming operations,
      the Project Drawdown analysis projects the total area under conservation agriculture
      will continue growing from 148 million hectares to peak at 400-327 million hectares
      by 2035. Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes
      more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will
      convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer
      demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted
      by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture
      offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions
      by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78
      tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs
      are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9
      trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion.'']'

  increase in managed grazing:

    comment: '[''Managed grazing involves carefully controlling livestock density
      and timing and intensity of grazing. Compared with conventional pasture practices,
      it can improve the health of grassland soils, sequestering carbon. By enhancing
      carbon sequestration compared to standard grazing practices, this solution can
      sequester 16.4-26 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050. However, this does not
      reduce the 10 gigatons of methane that are emitted on that grazing land today.
      Growth in adoption of managed grazing practices would need to rise from 71.6
      million hectares to 502.1-749.02 million hectares over thirty years. Financial
      lifetime returns are $2.1-3.4 trillion for net profit and 640.8-1010.8 billion
      for lifetime operational cost, on a $33.6-52.9 billion initial investment.'']'

      Multiple layers of trees and crops achieve high rates of both carbon sequestration

      agricultural systems; others can be converted or restored to it. If adopted
      on another 39-66 million hectares by 2050, from 100 million hectares currently,
      11.3-20.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide could be sequestered. Average sequestration

      annual cropping can include compost application, green manure, and organic production.
      It reduces emissions, increases soil organic matter, and sequesters carbon.
      From an estimated 11.84 million hectares of current adoption, Project Drawdown
      estimates regenerative annual cropping to increase to a total of 221-322 million
      hectares by 2050. This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth
      rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation
      agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result
      in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration
      and reduced emissions. Regenerative annual cropping could provide a $2.3-3.5

      Tree intercropping practices vary, but all increase biomass, soil organic matter,
      and carbon sequestration. Accounting for different sequestration rates across
      regions and intercropping systems, Project Drawdown estimates total sequestration
      of 15.0-24.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide over thirty years. To achieve that impact,
      adoption of tree intercropping would need to grow to 416-490 million hectares
      globally. On an initial investment of $147-227 billion and lifetime operational
      costs of $698-1080 billion, the potential profit, inclusive of those costs,
      could be as high as $262-428 billion.'']'

    comment: '["Various technologies and operational practices can lower airplane
      emissions to some degree. They include better engines, wingtips, and light weighting
      to improve fuel efficiency. Project Drawdown''s analysis focuses on adoption
      of the latest and most fuel-efficient aircraft; retrofitting existing aircraft
      with winglets, newer engines, and lighter interiors; and retiring older aircraft
      early. Over thirty years, and for a net cost of $830-850 billion, 6.3-9.2 gigatons
      of carbon dioxide emissions can be avoided, saving $2.5-3.6 trillion on lifetime
      jet-fuel and operating costs. Other efficiency measures could provide additional
      emissions reductions and savings as over 80 percent of aircraft are converted."]'

    comment: '[''Improved clean cookstoves can address the pollution from burning
      wood or biomass in traditional stoves. Using various technologies, they reduce
      emissions and protect human health. As of 2018, clean cookstoves were used by
      over 53% of families in developing regions with the rest using open wood or
      charcoal fires for cooking, with concomitant health and environmental effects.
      If policies for promoting clean cooking worldwide are aggressively implemented,
      guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of universal access to clean
      energy, reductions in emissions can amount to 31-73 gigatons of carbon dioxide
      equivalents at a net cost of $128-$264 billion. These stoves do raise cooking
      operating costs however by $2.0-$4.2 trillion over the stove lifetimes considering
      that many families collect firewood for free or buy cheap fuels today. These
      results include the reduction of black carbon, the second more impactful climate
      pollutant, by 8-20 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents. The additional benefits
      to the health of millions of households are not calculated here by Project Drawdown.'']'
