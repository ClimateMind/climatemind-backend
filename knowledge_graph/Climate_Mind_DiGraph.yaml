  composting:

    comment: '[''Composting can range from backyard bins to industrial-scale operations.
      Regardless, it converts organic waste into soil carbon, averting landfill methane
      emissions in the process. In 2015, an estimated 38 percent of food waste was
      composted in the United States; 57 percent was composted in the European Union.
      If all lower-income countries reached the U.S. rate and all higher-income countries
      achieved the E.U. rate, composting could avoid methane emissions from landfills
      equivalent to 2.1-3.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050. That total excludes
      additional gains from applying compost to soil. Compost facilities cost less
      to construct but more to operate, which is reflected in the financial results.'']'

    comment: "['Consumption of meat and dairy, as well as overall calories, often\
      \ exceeds nutritional recommendations. Paring down and favoring plant-based\
      \ foods reduces demand, thereby reducing land clearing, fertilizer use, burping\
      \ cattle, and greenhouse gas emissions. Using country-level data from the Food\
      \ and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Project Drawdown estimates\
      \ the growth in global food consumption by 2050, assuming that lower-income\
      \ countries will consume more food overall and higher quantities of meat as\
      \ economies grow. If 50-75 percent of the world\u2019s population restricts\
      \ their diet to a healthy average 2,250 calories per day and reduces meat consumption\
      \ overall, Project Drawdown estimates at least 43-68 gigatons of emissions could\
      \ be avoided from dietary change alone. If avoided deforestation from land use\
      \ change is included, an additional 21.8-23.5 gigatons of emissions could be\
      \ avoided, making healthy, plant-rich diets one of the most impactful solutions\
      \ at a total of 64.8-91.5 gigatons avoided.']"

      Project Drawdown''s carbon sequestration calculations include both living biomass

      hectare, resulting in a total of 8.3-21.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide sequestered

      of $566-1444 billion could yield a lifetime net profit of $1707-4348 billion.

  increase in conservation agriculture:
    classes:
    - test ontology
    - risk solution
    comment: '[''Conservation agriculture uses cover crops, crop rotation, and minimal
      tilling in the production of annual crops. It protects soil, avoids emissions,
      and sequesters carbon. \nBased on historic growth on large farming operations,
      the Project Drawdown analysis projects the total area under conservation agriculture
      will continue growing from 148 million hectares to peak at 400-327 million hectares
      by 2035. Project Drawdown assumes that as regenerative annual cropping becomes
      more widely used, farms that have already adopted conservation agriculture will
      convert to these more effective soil fertility practices in response to consumer
      demand for fewer harmful herbicides. The benefits of that conversion are counted
      by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture
      offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions
      by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78
      tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region. Establishment costs
      are low at $91.9-65.2 billion with a lifetime operational savings of $2.8-1.9
      trillion and lifetime net profit of $113.1-77.7 billion.'']'

    comment: '[''Managed grazing involves carefully controlling livestock density
      and timing and intensity of grazing. Compared with conventional pasture practices,
      it can improve the health of grassland soils, sequestering carbon. By enhancing
      carbon sequestration compared to standard grazing practices, this solution can
      sequester 16.4-26 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050. However, this does not
      reduce the 10 gigatons of methane that are emitted on that grazing land today.
      Growth in adoption of managed grazing practices would need to rise from 71.6
      million hectares to 502.1-749.02 million hectares over thirty years. Financial

    comment: '[''Building on conservation agriculture with additional practices, regenerative

      From an estimated 11.84 million hectares of current adoption, Project Drawdown
      estimates regenerative annual cropping to increase to a total of 221-322 million
      hectares by 2050. This rapid adoption is based in part on the historic growth
      rate of organic agriculture, as well as the projected conversion of conservation
      agriculture to regenerative annual cropping over time. This increase could result
      in a total reduction of 14.5-22.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide, from both sequestration
      and reduced emissions. Regenerative annual cropping could provide a $2.3-3.5
