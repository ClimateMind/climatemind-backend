Accounting for different sequestration rates across regions and intercropping systems, Project Drawdown estimates total sequestration of 15.0-24.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide over thirty years. To achieve that impact, adoption of tree intercropping would need to grow to 416-490 million hectares globally. On an initial investment of $147-227 billion and lifetime operational costs of $698-1080 billion, the potential profit, inclusive of those costs, could be as high as $262-428 billion.']",

The benefits of that conversion are counted by the regenerative annual cropping solution. Nonetheless, conservation agriculture offers significant benefits in the interim, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 13.4-9.4 gigatons based on average carbon sequestration rates of 0.25- 0.78 tons of carbon per hectare per year, depending on region.

Compared to annual crops, they have similar yields but higher rates of carbon sequestration. Perennial staple crops currently grow on approximately 50 million hectares, mostly in the tropics. Their rate of sequestration is high at 3.34 tons per hectare per year. Expand this area by another 601-141million hectares by 2050 and they can sequester 15.4-31.3 gigatons of additional carbon dioxide. Our analysis assumes that expansion only occurs on existing grassland, with no forest clearing. Because their yield is 2.4 times higher than annual staples\u2014at 60 percent of the cost\u2014savings are significant ranging from $1.4-3.3 trillion, with an establishment cost of $83-190 billion and lifetime operational cost of $848-1922 billion.']",

Two key assumptions inform that conclusion: (1) recycled paper produces about 25 percent fewer total emissions than conventional paper, and (2) the percentage of recycled paper being used to produce paper would rise from 55 percent to 69-74 percent by 2050. Although increasing recycled paper content uses more electricity, the emissions related to harvesting and processing\u2014and the total emissions from pulping and manufacturing\u2014are higher for paper using virgin wood feedstock.

Substantial emissions reductions could be achieved through the adoption of practices to (1) avoid leaks from refrigerants and (2) destroy refrigerants at end of life, both after the adoption of alternatives to HFC refrigerants. Over thirty years, an increase of over 79% percent of refrigerants that may be released can be contained, avoiding emissions equivalent to 57.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Although some revenue can be generated from resale of recovered refrigerant gases, the costs to establish and operate recovery, destruction, and leak avoidance outweigh the financial benefit\u2014meaning that refrigerant management, as modeled, could incur a net cost of $629.4 billion by 2050.']",

By transferring most of their energy use into creating light\u2014rather than heat, like older technologies\u2014LEDs reduce electricity consumption and air-conditioning loads. Although 2-3x more expensive than incandescent or fluorescent bulbs, they last much longer and are becoming cheaper to buy as technology improves. As LEDs replace less-efficient lighting, 10.2-10.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions could be avoided in residences and 5.9-6.7 gigatons in commercial buildings.']",
